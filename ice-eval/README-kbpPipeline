Evaluating slot filling:
this process is somewhat complicated because we do not have
a fully-annotated key;  the corpus is too large for that to
be possible.  Instead we pool system and human slot fills
and only assess those fills.

1. AnalyzeAssesments

The starting point is an assessment file which is processed
by AnalyzeAssessments. In its simplest form, it locates all
examples assessed as correct, and creates two lists for
each such example:

a document list lists the document presented as justification
for this example

a triples list lists the relational triple

2. Jet

Jet is run over this file, producing APF files with the
entities and extracted relations

3. ApfToTriple

This converts the APF files to triples

4. Infer

This performs very limited inference on the triples, such as

if X resides in y and y is a pat of z, x lives in z

5. Score triples

estimates recall by comparing the triples generated using
Jet with those from AnalyzeAssessments

to estimate precision, we must label all additional triples
generated by Jet as being correct or incorrect
