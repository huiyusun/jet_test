The Dutch boy who was the sole survivor of a Libyan plane crash that killed 103
people said he is "fine" in comments on Friday, as it emerged the pilot reported
no faults before the jet went down.
</P>
<P>
Nine-year-old Ruben van Assouw could remember nothing of Wednesday's crash and
was not yet aware that his parents and 11-year-old brother had died in the
accident, the Dutch newspaper Telegraaf reported.
</P>
<P>
"My name is Ruben and I am from Holland," Telegraaf reported on a telephone
conversation with the only survivor of the Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330 that
disintegrated on landing at Tripoli airport.
</P>
<P>
"I am fine, but my legs hurt a lot," the boy told a reporter from the newspaper
on the mobile phone of one of his doctors.
</P>
<P>
"I am in a hospital," Ruben said. "I don't know how I got here, I don't know
anything more. I really want to go home."
</P>
<P>
Siddiq ben Dilla, a doctor who operated on the boy's smashed legs, said on
Friday that his condition was improving and that he could travel home at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch foreign ministry said the boy would arrive back in the Netherlands on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ruben "will be accompanied by his uncle and aunt and the doctor treating him,"
spokesman Christoph Prommersberger told AFP.
</P>
<P>
They are set to fly out of Tripoli at 10:00 am (0800 GMT) for a destination in
the Netherlands the ministry refused to disclose. However, the Dutch federation
of tour operators said the plane was expected to land at the Eindhoven military
air field.
</P>
<P>
Officials said 70 Dutch citizens were among the 103 people killed in the crash,
although Afriqiyah Airways said on Friday there were 67 Dutch on board,
including the boy.
</P>
<P>
The airline said Flight 771 was also carrying 13 South Africans, 13 Libyans
including the 11 crew, as well as four Belgians, two Austrians, one Briton, a
French citizen, a German and a Zimbabwean.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign ministry said on Friday that one of the South Africans also
held German citizenship, while the nationality of one victim has yet to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, crash investigators said no technical problems were reported by the
pilot before the jet went down.
</P>
<P>
"The pilot did not report any problems. Until the very last moment things were
normal between the pilot and the control tower," Neji Dhaou, the head of the
commission of inquiry, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"What I can confirm for now is that the aircraft struck the ground before
reaching the runway," he said, adding the investigators "have ruled out nothing
for the moment."
</P>
<P>
On the day of the disaster, Libyan Transport Minister Mohammed Ali Zidan had
said "we have definitely ruled out the theory that the crash was the result of
an act of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Experts from the US National Transportation Safety Board are due to join the
inquiry later on Friday "because the engines and navigation system are American-
made," Dhaou said.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi's eldest son, Seif al-Islam, visited the boy on
Thursday at the hospital in the capital where he is recovering, the official
Jana news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Islam "asked about the health of the Dutch boy and about the treatment he is
receiving from doctors at Al-Khadra hospital," the Libyan news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch newspaper Brabants Dagblad said Ruben was probably from Tilburg in the
southern Netherlands and that he had been on safari in South Africa with his
mother Trudy, 41, father Patrick, 40, and brother Enzo, 11.
</P>
<P>
He had greeted an aunt and uncle with a smile when they arrived at his Tripoli
bedside on Thursday, according to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
The boy's grandmother, An van de Sande, said in a report on Thursday that the
holiday had been to celebrate the couple's copper wedding anniversary -- marked
in the Netherlands after 12.5 years.
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand. It's like we're in a film," she was quoted as saying by
Brabants Dagblad.
</P>
<P>
In a 14-day blog account of a fun-filled holiday in southern Africa, Patrick van
Assouw wrote of long car trips through beautiful scenery, swimming in natural
pools, eating junk food and spotting monkeys, giraffes and elephants.
