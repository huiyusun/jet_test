A bright smile of relief lit up Adele Doba's face after she finally cast a vote
on Sunday in Ivory Coast's first election in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Like many Ivorians, Doba rose before dawn to line up to vote even before the
polling station in Yopougon, a district of Abidjan, had opened.
</P>
<P>
"I voted for peace," said the mother-of-six.
</P>
<P>
Doba cast her vote for Laurent Gbagbo, the incumbent facing the electorate for
the first time since 2000 after repeatedly extending his mandate after the
expiry of his term five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The vote is principally a contest between three political heavyweights: Gbagbo,
former prime minister Alassane Dramane Ouattara, and former president Henri
Konan Bedie.
</P>
<P>
In Abidjan, the country's economic capital which is home to a third of the 5.7
million registered voters, people queued patiently and calmly for polling
stations to open under the watchful gaze of security forces.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy because we're going to have peace, our children are going to have
work," said Monique Kanga, allowed to go to the head of the queue because of her
age when she voted in the Koumassi district.
</P>
<P>
With his cap on his head, IT worker Jules Ahore proudly threw his ballot into
the box at a polling station decked out in the country's orange, white and green
national colours in the upmarket Cocody neighbourhood.
</P>
<P>
"I feel free, it's like I am at church and I have come to take communion," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the central city of Bouake, a stronghold of former rebel forces, streets were
almost deserted and shops shut, with voters travelling to schools to cast their
ballots at appointed times.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are free, I think Ivory Coast will rediscover itself," said Azita Bamba,
a shopkeeper who came to a polling station with her six children.
</P>
<P>
Lassina Toure, a 35-year-old driver, said the election marked a turning point
for Dioula people, mainly Muslim residents in northern areas of the country who
claim to have suffered stigmatisation and discrimination since the outbreak of
civil war in 2002.
</P>
<P>
"Before, when you said you were called Toure, Kone or Bamba, they said you
weren't Ivorian," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But in performing my civic duty today, I have rediscovered my citizenship."
