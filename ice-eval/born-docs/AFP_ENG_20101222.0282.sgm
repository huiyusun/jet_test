Ivory Coast trembles as 'Street General' back on stage

<P>
The bloody stand-off in Ivory Coast brought a notorious figure back to centre
stage -- Laurent Gbagbo's "General of the Street", hardline rabble-rousing
showman Charles Ble Goude.
</P>
<P>
Ble Goude is best known for leading violent protests of his "Young Patriots"
against Ivory Coast's former colonial power France on the streets of Abidjan
during previous crises in 2003 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
For that, he earned a place on a United Nations list of extremists, banned from
international travel and accused of "acts of violence by street militias,
including beatings, rapes and extrajudicial killings".
</P>
<P>
Now, he is a key Gbagbo supporter as the strongman clings on to power in the
face of international pressure to step down and make way for his rival Alassane
Ouattara, who has been recognised by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Gbagbo named Ble Goude minister for youth in his unrecognised government and his
diehard supporter has taken to the streets once again, organising a daily series
of rallies in support of the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
Once again, France and the UN have been targets of his colourful rhetoric, but
he has so far refrained from overt calls to violence, demanding instead a
"peaceful combat" to restore Ivorian "dignity and sovereignty".
</P>
<P>
He paints Ouattara as a puppet of foreign leaders -- reserving particular
suspicion for France's President Nicolas Sarkozy -- and echoes Gbagbo's demand
that French and UN peacekeepers quit the country.
</P>
<P>
As a minister he sports sharp suits and elegant ties, but among his core
constituents, street toughs and veterans of Abidjan's rough and ready student
political scene, he dons a baseball cap and scarf in national colours.
</P>
<P>
"I'm 100 percent minister, and 100 percent general," he explains.
</P>
<P>
Mixing chants, song and political diatribe he fires up the crowds -- in meetings
that are promoted in advance then exhaustively covered on state television --
but stops short of unleashing the mob.
</P>
<P>
"Gbagbo is not some under-prefect in Sarkozy's government," he declared, at a
meeting in Yopougon, a sprawling pro-Gbagbo suburb of Abidjan, picking up where
he left off abusing former French leader Jacques Chirac in 2004.
</P>
<P>
"Ivory Coast is not a region of France," he declared, to cheers, in a deliberate
bid to revive memories of the former conflict that made his name.
</P>
<P>
In 2004 French forces in Ivory Coast reacted to an air strike that killed nine
of their men by destroying Gbagbo's entire air force.
</P>
<P>
Rioting erupted in Abidjan, with gangs of "Young Patriots" targeting France's
still substantial interests and large expatriate community in the city. French
troops responded robustly, killing 50 civilian protesters.
</P>
<P>
"There are moments when you have to realise you're making a date with History,"
he told AFP this week, vowing to defeat what he and his supporters see as
Sarkozy's colonialist scheming.
</P>
<P>
"He'll have to march over our dead bodies to get to Gbagbo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ble Goude was born in 1972 in Gbagbo's centre west home region, Guiberoua, and
rose to become secretary general of the powerful and aggressive Students'
Federation of Ivory Coast (FESCI).
</P>
<P>
In 2002, after a failed coup split Ivory Coast into warring camps, he took to
the streets to form what he called "the patriotic galaxy" uniting various youth
groups to defend Gbagbo's rule.
</P>
<P>
As well as provoking the fatal clashes with the French forces, the protests led
to ethnic and political killings between rival Ivorian factions, and Ble Goude
was sanctioned by the United Nations for violence.
</P>
<P>
In 2008, the US embassy said in a cable revealed by WikiLeaks, that "an
offensive seems to be underway, bolstered by the presidential camp, to re-shape
Ble Goude's public image and portray him as a future statesman."
</P>
<P>
"According to the French Embassy, Ble Goude has become a wealthy businessman,
with substantial holdings in hotels, nightclubs, restaurants, gas stations, and
real estate," it said.
</P>
<P>
The French said they believe Goude "requires payment for all activities he
undertakes on behalf of the Presidency and the FPI governing party."
</P>
<P>
So, is Ble Goude today a thug for hire or a reformed patriot? He told AFP that
he was for "non-violence" and compared himself improbably to Gandhi, Martin
Luther King and Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
A former FESCI colleague had a different take: "He's very intelligent but he
wants power and will use all means to get it. He's a manipulator and knows how
to profit from the weakness of his enemies."
</P>
<P>
Either way, he will play a key role in what happens next.
