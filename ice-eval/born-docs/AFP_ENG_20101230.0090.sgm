Incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo's forces in Ivory Coast have repeatedly stopped
UN peacekeepers getting to a village where rights investigators suspect there is
a mass grave, UN officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
New reports of armed groups blocking the road to Anyama came as a UN envoy on
the prevention of genocide raised new concerns about events in the West African
nation where Gbagbo is refusing to stand down after losing an election.
</P>
<P>
"Our human rights monitoring team have been attempting to investigate reports of
mass graves in several locations including at Anyama," said UN peacekeeping
department spokesman Nick Birnback.
</P>
<P>
"Thus far their efforts have been blocked by followers of the former president
but they will continue to look into this," Birnback told AFP.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has been kept informed of the investigation in
briefings by the UN mission in Ivory Coast, his spokesman Martin Nesirky said.
</P>
<P>
Gbagbo's supporters turned away the latest attempt to reach Anyama, in the
suburbs of the main city of Abidjan, on Tuesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The village is populated by supporters of Gbagbo and his rival Alassane
Ouattara, who has been declared winner of the November 28 election and is backed
by the United Nations and international community.
</P>
<P>
Gbagbo's supporters around the village are armed with rocket launchers and other
weapons, according to UN officials.
</P>
<P>
The UN mission in Ivory Coast has said that the number of reported deaths has
fallen in recent days. But the new Ivory Coast ambassador to the United Nations,
Youssoufou Bamba, said Wednesday that his country was "on the brink of genocide"
and called for UN action.
</P>
<P>
Two senior advisors to the UN secretary general also expressed concern Thursday
over events in the West African nation.
</P>
<P>
"There are continuing reports, so far unconfirmable, of serious human rights
violations by supporters of Mr Laurent Gbagbo and by forces under his control as
well as the use of inflammatory speech to incite hatred and violence," said
Francis Deng, a special advisor on the prevention of genocide.
</P>
<P>
He said allegations that the Abidjan homes of Gbagbo opponents "had been marked
to identify their ethnicity were extremely worrying."
</P>
<P>
More than 180 people have been killed in attacks in recent weeks, according to
UN figures, and Deng and Edward Luck, a special rights advisor to the UN
secretary general, both "expressed grave concern" over Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
"They drew attention particularly to indications that some leaders there are
inciting violence between different elements of the population so as to serve
their political purposes.
</P>
<P>
"Given the history of internal conflict in CÃ´te d'Ivoire," they warned, "such
actions are highly irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
They said accusations that Gbagbo's camp was inciting hatred and violence "has
especially dangerous implications which are completely unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
UN leader Ban has warned all sides in Ivory Coast that attacks on civilians
could lead to charges under international humanitarian law.
