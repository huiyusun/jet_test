Canada's unemployment rate rose to 8.4 percent in May, the highest level in 11 years and up slightly from the eight percent registered in April.

Statistics Canada announced Friday the country lost 42,000 jobs in May. Since the recession began last October, 363,000 workers have lost their jobs, with 234,000 of those coming in Ontario, Canada's most populous province.

<P>
The U.S. labor market is about 10 times the size of Canada's so the U.S.-equivalent of 42,000 jobs lost based on labor market size would be 420,000.
