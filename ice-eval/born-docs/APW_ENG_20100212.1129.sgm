Defense official Gail McGinn says in a memo to the Pentagon's Inspector General that it expects to begin doing so this year. McGinn's comments are included in an inspector's report that also recommends the Pentagon develop plans to provide help to assaulted U.S. contractors.

The IG investigation was initiated by a request from congressional members concerned about allegations such as those by a Texas woman, Jamie Leigh Jones. Jones has filed a lawsuit alleging she was raped by military contractor co-workers in Iraq in 2005.
