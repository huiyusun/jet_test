Dear Friends:

Jean Chretien was in Calgary this week to sign copies
of his latest volume, &quot;My Years as Prime Minister.&quot;

Rarely in my 36 Western Canada Liberal years -
Ontario-born but transplanted permanently here-
have I had an opportunity to vote for a national or
provincial candidate reflective of my political roots.
I have even been known to vote for Edward Schreyer (NDP)
of Manitoba and Peter Lougheed (Conservative) of Alberta
because I liked what they stood for and were doing for
their constituencies.

That's also why, in spite of everything, I am still a
fan of Jean Chretien. I have never been prouder of that
than when he signed my copy of his new book at the
Memorial Library in Calgary this past Wednesday.

Hundreds of others who came that night seemed to feel
the same way and he had a personal word to share with
each one.

Politics is important, and party positions count.
But sometimes personalities transcend their political,
social and geographical cultures. They make great
efforts, for example, to reach across boundaries -
as I saw Chretien the Quebecois doing in Alberta
over the years.

&quot;Thank you, sir, for what you have done for our
country,&quot; I said to him, admiringly.

&quot;Sir?&quot; he replied, obviously pleased, and he then
proceeded to sign and talk about other memorable
Calgary occasions for him - here in this symbolic
bastion of Canadian conservativatism.

Colleague Matthew Zachariah raises a good question
this week as CL continues a theme begun last week.
&quot;Why study atheism?&quot; he asks. I offer a reply.

_____

I also provide background on the new Christmas movie
release &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; which some suspect
is as an attempt to spread godlessness among the
impressionable young. Read all about it, here,
and hopefully your faith and the faith of other
impressionables will be enhanced!
_____

Colleagues, representing the reading spectrum of
this letter, share some timely, seasonal material
this week.

Ron Rolheiser offers an Advent reflection;
Don Grayston thinks about celebrating Christmas;
and Lorna Dueck struggles with how to focus on the
Christian message in a multi-cultural, pluralistic
and secularized world.

Thanks to all three of you!

Reflective people know that North American
evangelicalism is evolving. Putting the terms
&quot;evangelical&quot; and &quot;evolution&quot; together is not
an oxymoron!

I provide a rather lengthy dual-report to make
my point this week. First, colleague John G.
Stackhouse Jr. of Regent Colleage, Vancouver
presents a document to help define what
&quot;Canadian Evangelicalism&quot; means.

A fine job, John!

Then, I offer some background on Jim Wallis,
hardly a stranger to many of you. I have been
reading his books - and Sojourners magazine
which he founded - for two decades. Wallis
is an American evangelical - but clearly not
of the traditional sort. While suspect in his
own theological family for years, his day
seems to be arriving. Many evangelicals from
around the world, and other Christians too -
respect him.

Both Stackhouse and Wallis represent a new
face of what it means to be an evangelical
Christian in North America today. They have
important things to tell us all.

National Catholic Reporter (Kansas City, MO)
has produced an intriguing set of articles
on the &quot;women priest movement&quot; within
Catholicism.

Read the editorial &quot;Finished playing by the rules&quot;
and then three other articles on the personalities
and the passion behind this movement that I believe
will have a significant long-term impact on the
currently celibate-male-dominated Roman Catholic
Church.

_____

Pope Benedict XVI provided me with an opportunity
to write for a large Catholic audience this year
when 31 Catholic websites and realted hardcopy
newspapers, worldwide (last count) published my
review of his book on Jesus.

Though aware of his advancing years, Benedict
continues to write prolifically about important
themes. Some months ago, he produced an encyclical
on &quot;love.&quot; Now, he writes about &quot;hope.&quot; I have
provided the links to his entire missive, and to
his comments on the document, below.

(Sadly, I did not attend any papal book-signing!)
_____

This week, I provide both a Canadian and a global
potpourri of faith - offered through the services
of Anglican Church Canada Webnews (Toronto) and
Ecumenical News International (Geneva).
_____

Students, especially good students, are part of the
satisfying legacy of any teacher, and I cherish them.
One student (I was privileged to share classroom space
with her during the 1990s) made the effort to write me
this Christmas.

I can't help but share her comments, below.
_____

My Christmas cards are mailed. Our travel blog for
2007 is updated, and I hope to use the last two weeks
before Christmas in spiritually meaningful ways.

I wish the same for you.

Wayne

WHY STUDY ATHEISM?
A Colleague's Question Worth Considering

Hello Wayne:

There was informal discussion around coffee last Sunday about why you
- or others - are giving so much additional exposure to books like
&quot;The God Delusion&quot; that are very one-sided, even if on best seller lists.
I partly agreed with the observation and said that I will read one or
two reviews of such books but will not waste my precious reading time
with them when other more worthwhile books are clamouring for my
attention.

Matthew Zachariah
Emeritus Professor
Faculty of Education
University of Calgary

MY RESPONSE:

Dear Matthew and Others Who May be Thinking Similarly:

My first reaction, was very much as your's, when the current batch
of &quot;atheism books&quot; started appearing two years ago. I read Sam Harris,
for example, and he reminded me in many ways of my college years!
In every philosophy class (especially as a second year arts/humanities
student) there was that brassy, articulate self-styled atheist - and
I guess that is where the derogatory term &quot;sophmoric&quot; comes from. My
first reaction to Harris, and then Dawkins and Hitchens, was that they
were adolescent self-promoters who get a charge out of taking potshots
at &quot;sacred cows.&quot;

My more studied response, however, has been something different.
These writers and others like them, are appearing at at time in our
culture when &quot;theism&quot; (belief in a traditional view of the God of
the Judeo-Christian tradition) is undergoing considerable scrutiny
and challenge.

Writers like John Spong, Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan have been
signalling this trend for two or more decades. But it is only now -
in the wake of crises like the tragic &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; war in
Iraq, the priest-destroying child-abuse scandals, the struggles over gay
rights, the debates over creationism/evolution, the apparent break-up of
the Anglican communion, etc. - that the issue of spiritual authority has
once again moved into the centre of public consciousness.

Ultimately we are dealing with questions of authority. With &quot;theism&quot; -
what kind of God can we believe in? What scriptures or church structures
can adequately provide guidance from that God for those of us who still
want to believe in divinity?

In the past, this debate was largely confined to the academy. Today,
however, it has hit mainstream cultures of the West with a vengeance.

Traditional Christians usually take a very defensive stance to the often
defiant expressions of atheism. People of an &quot;emerging Christian way&quot;
will frequently side with atheists against some of the traditional ways
of understanding God. This does not mean the latter are atheists. It
means they are seeking ways to understand God that also face honestly
the meaning of modernity.

They want to respect the scientific method, the integration of science
and faith; as well as inter-faith and multi-cultural realities. They want
to affirm rather than condemn human, God-given sexualities. They want to
be serious in their approach to the Bible without being literal about it.

All of these issues, and many others too, boil down to the basic human
need for a dependable religious authority.

Many people believe that the religious authorities they trusted in the
past (officials, scriptures, institutions) have lied to them and let
them

Wayne,
I am a fan of Jean Chretien's for his love of Canada and the fact that he
stood up to Bush!!!  He did a fine job, IMHO, in any portfolio he occupied.
I, too, was a lonely voting Liberal in Calgary when I taught out there.  My,
then, boyfriend used to tease that was why he dated me.....
