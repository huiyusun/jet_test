Brazilian goalkeeper Bruno has been suspended by his team Flamengo after police
opened an investigation into the death of a woman said to be the mother of his
child, according to reports here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Bruno has been sidelined from the rest of the team and remains at the disposal
of the judiciary. No date has been set for his reintegration," Flamengo director
Patricia Amorim told the press.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old captain of Flamengo, one of Brazil's most popular teams, is
suspected of being involved in the disappearance three weeks ago and possible
death of Eliza Samudio.
</P>
<P>
Samudio, 25, had been demanding a DNA test to prove that the married footballer
was the father of her four-month-old child.
</P>
<P>
Police carried out a search Monday of the goalkeeper's home near Belo Horizonte
and, according to police chief Edson Moreira, found "strong evidence that Eliza
had been there" before disappearing on June 4 or 5.
</P>
<P>
Her baby, who was allegedly hidden by the goalkeeper's wife at a friend's home,
was located last Saturday at Contagem in the same region.
</P>
<P>
Samudio's lawyer Anne Faraco claimed that Bruno had offered her client a monthly
allowance of 3,500 reais (1,900 dollars), but she had been demanding more -
angering the footballer.
</P>
<P>
According to Faraco and a friend of Samudio the footballer had threatened her
during her pregnancy and demanded that she have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
Samudio had filed a complaint with police last October when she was five months
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
Bruno, whose full name is Bruno Fernandes de Sousa, told Globo radio on Monday
he had a "clear conscience. In the future I'll be able to laugh at all this."
