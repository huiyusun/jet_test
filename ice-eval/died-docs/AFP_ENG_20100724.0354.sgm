<P>
Police in southwestern China have arrested 46 people in an organised crime gang,
including a top shareholder of a Hilton Hotel shut after it was found running a
prostitution ring, state media said.
</P>
<P>
The arrests came in the municipality of Chongqing, where authorities have since
last year carried out a major mafia crackdown that has exposed a thriving
underworld in the mega-city of 30 million people.
</P>
<P>
Those arrested included Peng Zhimin, 47, owner of Qinglong Property Development
Co, which in turn owned the Chongqing Hilton Hotel, official Xinhua news agency
said in a report late Friday.
</P>
<P>
Peng was arrested on organised crime, prostitution, bribery, intentional injury,
and other charges, it said, quoting local police.
</P>
<P>
It said the former director and vice director of a district-level agriculture,
forestry and water resources bureau also were detained for allegedly sheltering
the gang.
</P>
<P>
The hotel was shut down in late June over the prostitution and organised crime
allegations.
</P>
<P>
The Hilton International Hotel Group, which manages the business in a joint
venture with the property company, said at the time it was fully cooperating
with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Reports last month had said 22 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Peng ran a club in the hotel where prostitution, drug abuse, gambling and gang
activities were carried out, Xinhua quoted police as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also is charged with seeking protection from officials by bribing them with
money and sex, it added.
</P>
<P>
It said Peng had built a fortune selling fake cigarettes and in real estate. He
served a previous jail term for theft.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing crime crackdown has resulted in more than 3,300 detentions and
hundreds of prosecutions, including the trials of nearly 100 officials.
</P>
<P>
China earlier this month executed Wen Qiang, a former top Chongqing police and
justice official at the centre of the scandal. He had been convicted on charges
including rape and taking bribes to protect criminal gangs.
