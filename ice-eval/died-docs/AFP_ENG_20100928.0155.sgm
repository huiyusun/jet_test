A New Jersey restaurateur who shot to prominence as celebrity chef Gordon
Ramsay's target in the "Kitchen Nightmares" reality show, has committed suicide
in the Hudson River, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Cerniglia, the 39-year-old owner of an Italian eatery called Campania,
was seen by viewers in the 2007 episode of "Kitchen Nightmares" being berated by
Ramsay for sloppy service and poor food.
</P>
<P>
He admitted on air to being close to bankruptcy, as Ramsay, a volatile and foul-
mouthed British chef, warned him that the business was "about to swim down the
Hudson."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Cerniglia's body was found in the river, apparently after he leapt
from the towering George Washington Bridge that connects New York City to New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
"It was a suicide. He died from drowning and blunt impact. He jumped from a
height," the New York Medical Examiner's office told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Cerniglia was the second former star in one of Ramsay's shows to commit suicide,
the New York Post reported. Chef Rachel Brown, 41, took part in the "Hell's
Kitchen" series in 2006 and shot herself in Texas.
</P>
<P>
Cerniglia's family posted a message of thanks to well-wishers on his Facebook
page and asked "that in lieu of flowers a financial donation be made to Joe's
family to help provide for Joe's wife Melissa and their 3 sons."
