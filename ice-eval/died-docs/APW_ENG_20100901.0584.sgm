A jury says a British government scientist died during secret anti-terrorism experiments that were not properly planned or organized.
</P>
<P>
An inquest into the death of Terry Jupp, who died on a remote island off England's east coast used as a military facility, found Wednesday that there were failures in planning, risk assessment, communication and organization of the joint British-American tests.
</P>
<P>
Jupp suffered severe burns in a blast in August 2002. The 46-year-old died of his injuries six days later.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals involved have never been revealed, though previous investigations disclosed scientists were studying types of homemade bombs likely to be built by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The inquest was delayed for years amid a criminal investigation and security concerns.
