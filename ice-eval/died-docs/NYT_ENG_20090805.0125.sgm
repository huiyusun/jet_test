GUNMAN DREW DARK PORTRAIT OF LONELINESS BEFORE SHOOTING WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BRIDGEVILLE, Pa.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tortured by loneliness and his lack of
success with women, George Sodini developed a plan to get even. On
Tuesday night, he executed it, opening fire in a fitness center
here and hitting 12 women, three fatally, before turning a gun on
himself.
</P>
<P>
Sodini, 48, described his anger and frustration in painstaking
detail in notes he carried with him and left at his home and in a
chilling online diary, offering an extraordinarily stark portrait
of a killer's motives. Officials said Sodini, of Scott Township, a
suburb about six miles southwest of Pittsburgh, prepared for the
assault for at least nine months, buying ammunition and at least
three guns and making practice runs to the fitness center.
</P>
<P>
By the time he killed himself with a shot to his head a minute
after the attack began, Sodini, who had no prior criminal record or
known history of mental illness, had fired at least 36 shots from
two 9 mm semi-automatic weapons, but never fully emptied either of
the 30-round clips on the guns, or reloaded with the two full clips
found in his bag.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know why he stopped shooting, just thank God that he
did," said Charles Moffatt, the superintendent of the Allegheny
County Police Department, which is leading the investigation. "He
just had a lot of hatred in him and he was hell bent on doing this
act."
</P>
<P>
Of the nine injured women, three of them were still in serious
condition on Wednesday at a local hospital, Moffatt said.
</P>
<P>
In his online journal, which has since been taken off the
Internet, Sodini, a programmer-analyst at a local law firm, said
that he had not had a girlfriend since 1984 and that he had not had
sex since July 1990, when he was 29.
</P>
<P>
"I actually look good," Sodini wrote in an entry dated Dec.
29, 2008. "I dress good, am clean-shaven, bathe, touch of cologne
-- yet 30 million women rejected me -- over an 18- or 25-year period.
That is how I see it. Thirty million is my rough guesstimate of how
many desirable single women there are.
</P>
<P>
"A man needs a woman for confidence. He gets a boost on the
job, career, with other men, and everywhere else when he knows
inside he has someone to spend the night with and who is also a
friend."
</P>
<P>
At some point on Monday, Sodini updated his diary with his
intention to finally go through with the attack -- after he
"chickened out" on another Tuesday in January -- and he included
his birth date and date of death: 8/4/2009.
</P>
<P>
Sodini's writings and rationale are all too familiar, said Dr.
Michael Welner, a forensic psychologist and adjunct law professor
at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, who has studied mass
murderers.
</P>
<P>
"Mass shooters aim for the attention and notoriety of other
mass shooters," he said. "If you read this blog, it may explain
to the reader why he feels hopeless, but it doesn't explain why he
decides to take the lives of innocent strangers, which is the
point. He's channeling that sense of masculine, sexual failure into
a conquest that results in a mass killing."
</P>
<P>
The attack took place in a "Latin Impact" aerobics class with
about 22 women in it on Tuesday at about 8:15 p.m. at an LA Fitness
center in a shopping center in Collier Township, about 12 miles
southwest of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
Moffatt said Sodini had not known anyone in the class, and chose
it simply because it had a lot of women in it. Dressed in a black
headband and black workout jacket and pants, Sodini walked casually
in into the 30-foot-by-40-foot room.
</P>
<P>
He put his black gym bag on the floor and then fumbled around
for his weapons, the police said. He then turned off the lights.
</P>
<P>
"He did not say anything," Moffatt said of Sodini, who was a
member of the fitness center. "He walked right to the room as if
he knew where he was going and started shooting."
</P>
<P>
The dead were identified as Heidi Overmier, 46, of Carnegie,
Pa., director of group sales at Kennywood Amusement Park; Elizabeth
Gannon, 49, of Pittsburgh, who worked in the radiation department
at Allegheny General Hospital; and Jody Billingsley, 37, of Mount
Lebanon, Pa., a sales representative for a medical equipment
company.
</P>
<P>
Trish Cowen, who lived across the street from Sodini for 13
years, said he had been friendly but had largely kept to himself.
"I never saw any women over there, and he wasn't bad looking,"
Cowen said. "I don't understand it. I just assumed he was gay."
</P>
<P>
In the Web diary, Sodini described his final preparations for
the attack.
</P>
<P>
"I took off today, Monday, and tomorrow to practice my routine
and make sure it is well polished," he wrote. "I need to work out
every detail, there is only one shot. Also I need to be completely
immersed into something before I can be successful. I haven't had a
drink since Friday at about 2:30. Total effort needed. Tomorrow is
the big day."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Any of the 'Practice Papers' left on my coffee table
I used or the notes in my gym bag can be published freely. I will
not be embarrassed, because, well, I will be dead."
</P>
<P>
Sodini owned his own home, which he bought for $78,000 in 1996.
He said in the diary that he had assets of $250,000 and that he had
recently been promoted.
</P>
<P>
In a July entry in his diary, Sodini took notice of a
"beautiful college-aged girl" leaving Cowen's home, apparently
Cowen's 22-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
"Right now my heart is just numb," Cowen said. "What would
have happened if he had a gun and my daughter had been out there?
</P>
<P>
"I'm just grateful he didn't take it out on us when my daughter
was here," she said. "It is so tragic. You never would have
thought, 'Our neighbor,' you know?"
