' TICKET TO THE CIRCUS ' : THE IMPROBABLE RIDE OF THE LAST MRS. MAILER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Barbara Jean Davis -- the future Norris Church Mailer -- met
Norman Mailer at a party in Russellville, Ark., in 1975, she was a
high school art teacher and divorced single mother. She'd never
flown in an airplane.She had a closet full of polyester clothes.
When she took Mailer back to her house that first evening, she
poured him a glass of Boone's Farm apple wine. Norman Mailer was,
well, Norman Mailer: novelist, public intellectual, brawling social
provocateur. His best work ("The Naked and the Dead," "Armies of
the Night") might have been largely behind him, but he was
America's best-known and most notorious writer, as famous for his
deeds off the page as on. He'd run for mayor of New York City;been
married five times; had stabbed his second wife, Adele, in a
drunken fit after a party; and was the impish scourge of feminists.
His reputation, like his round belly, preceded him.
</P>
<P>
In her entertaining new memoir, "A Ticket to the Circus,"
Norris Mailer writes that she found that belly, as well as his
"cute little" behind, sort of sexy. Norman Mailer, at 52, may
have been twice her age but was "easily the most interesting man I
had ever met." He radiated energy, she writes, "like a little
steam heater." (Mailer knew from steam heaters. She'd already had
a small relationship with Bill Clinton, before he'd married
Hillary.)
</P>
<P>
Before long, Barbara and Norman were a couple. He sent her love
letters in the Barry White mold. ("And you, stand-up lady, are
golden as the sun.") She cut his wooly hair and saved the
clippings in a white satin heart-shaped pillow. He soon
disentangled from his fifth wife and various other lovers. She
moved to New York and, for her intermittent modeling career, took
the name Norris Church. She became Mailer's sixth wife in 1980, and
gave birth to his son John Buffalo. She was with him until he died,
in November of 2007.
</P>
<P>
"A Ticket to the Circus" is not a tell-all memoir; it's a
tell-enough memoir. It's Mailer's own plucky and sometimes
sentimental autobiography, written in the lemony sweet-tea mode of
Southern novelists like Lee Smith. It details her Arkansas
upbringing in a poor family: Her father built roads; the family had
an outhouse. At 3, Mailer won the Little Miss Little Rock contest.
She was married by 20, to a man who left to serve in Vietnam, and
soon began to hear a voice in her head "telling me I had missed
the parade."
</P>
<P>
Mailer doesn't hide the darker elements in her story: Her
mother's shock therapy treatments, her own rape by a friend's older
brother. She also includes embarrassing bits other memoirists might
have omitted, including goopy letters and poems she sent Mailer.
</P>
<P>
You were there and
      I was there
      in a pocket
      of sunshine
      in a vacuum of space.
</P>
<P>
This book perks up when Norman Mailer strides fully onto the
stage. He became the "Henry Higgins to my Eliza Doolittle," the
author writes, and soon Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell and Woody Allen
and Jackie Onassis were coming to their parties; they flew to
Manila for an Ali-Frazier fight and hung with Imelda Marcos; they
palled around with the Ramones and Farrah Fawcett and Fidel Castro.
She ran Mailer's life like a ship, and organized the family events
and vacations that held his big family together. Yet, she writes,
"Sex was the cord that bound us together."
</P>
<P>
"A Ticket to the Circus" spills over with piquant details
about Norman Mailer. He was a terrible driver. He liked to arrive
hours early for airplane flights. He had few literary friends. He
professed to love jazz, but it was only the atmosphere he liked --
he detested the music. He was fanatical about coleslaw. His best
move, in a fight, was a head butt. Later in life, his cocktail of
choice was red wine mixed with a bit of orange juice, what Norris
Mailer calls "a mild sangria punch." He cheerfully woke his kids
up, during vacations, with vulgar chants he'd learned in the Army.
</P>
<P>
Norris Mailer does not dig deeply into Mailer's writing, nor
into his reputation as a crackling antagonist to feminists. The
macho bluster in his book "The Prisoner of Sex" (1971), she
suggests, was misunderstood:
</P>
<P>
"To me, the humor and irony was inherent, but you can't
transfer the twinkle in the eye to the page, so a lot of people
treated everything he said as perfectly serious, like his famous
comment that women should be kept in cages. Who would think he was
serious about that?"
</P>
<P>
"A Ticket to the Circus" is a love story, and you won't read
this memoir without feeling pangs of jealousy: These two lived
large, sun-drenched lives in almost every regard. That life also
meant, for Norris Mailer, a good deal of heartbreak. He continued
to take lovers, and he sometimes gave her laughable excuses for
them. While he was working on his CIA novel, "Harlot's Ghost"
(1991), she writes, "He said he needed to live that kind of double
life, to know what his characters were going through."
</P>
<P>
She took an emotional step away from him because of the affairs,
she writes, and although she loved him, she never took that step
back. At one point, she asks: "Why had I been so consumed by this
old, fat, bombastic, lying little dynamo?"
</P>
<P>
Norman Mailer's end was not pretty. Before undergoing bypass
surgery late in his life, his doctors made him get all his teeth
pulled, to prevent infection.
</P>
<P>
"That was the beginning of his decline," Norris Mailer writes.
His dental implants didn't take, and he was forced to wear false
teeth that never quite fit. He began to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
Mailer had her own health problems, including a long battle with
cancer. It's one she's still fighting. You believe her when she
writes, near the end of this gracious memoir, "If I go tomorrow, I
will still be ahead."
