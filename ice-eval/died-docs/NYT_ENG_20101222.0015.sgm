FRANK BALDINO JR., FOUNDER OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, DIES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Frank Baldino Jr. who founded the pharmaceutical company
Cephalon, best known for the drug Provigil, which is used to
increase alertness, died Thursday in Philadelphia. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
The cause was complications related to leukemia, the company
said in a statement. In August, Baldino, who lived in West Chester,
Pa., had taken a leave of absence from his posts as Cephalon's
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
The company, which Baldino founded in 1987, sells a variety of
drugs, including some that are used to treat pain and sleepiness.
Besides Provigil, its best-known brands include Actiq, a
painkiller, and Gabitril, a treatment for seizure disorders.
</P>
<P>
Provigil, which was originally approved to treat sleepiness
related to narcolepsy, became a huge success, used by millions of
people, who generally found that it kept them alert with little or
none of the jitteriness associated with caffeine or the euphoria
and often addiction resulting from amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
Provigil was particularly popular with college students,
long-haul truckers and others who needed to stay awake late into
the night.
</P>
<P>
"There are no warts on this drug," Baldino said in 2002. "The
only question is how big we can make it."
</P>
<P>
By 2004, Cephalon said that 90 percent of all prescriptions for
the drug were for "off label" uses, including fatigue,
depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and sleepiness
caused by other prescription medications.
</P>
<P>
Despite its success, Cephalon had its share of run-ins with the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
In 2007, the company said it would pay $425 million to settle a
federal investigation into its sales and marketing practices and
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of federal prescription
drug laws.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has sued Cephalon,
saying it made illegal deals with generic drug companies to delay
generic competition to Provigil. Cephalon disputes that.
</P>
<P>
And the company paid $17 million to settle shareholder lawsuits
accusing Baldino and other executives of overstating the
effectiveness of an experimental drug for Lou Gehrig's disease. The
company said it had settled for reasons of expediency and denied
any wrongdoing. Seven outsiders associated with the company were
charged with insider trading.
</P>
<P>
Baldino was born May 13, 1953, and grew up in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. He graduated from Muhlenberg College in Allentown,
Pa., and received a Ph.D. in pharmacology from Temple University.
</P>
<P>
He worked for seven years in the 1980s for E.I. du Pont de
Nemours as a senior research biologist developing potential drugs.
During his career, he wrote more than 100 publications in
peer-reviewed journals, Cephalon said.
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Sandra; four sons, Jeff, James,
Douglas and Harris; a daughter, Leslie; his mother, Sally; and two
brothers, Guy and Paul.
