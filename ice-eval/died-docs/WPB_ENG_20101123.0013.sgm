</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norris Church Mailer, who was the sixth and final wife of Pulitzer Prize-winning
novelist Norman Mailer and was also a model, a painter and a respected author in
her own right, died Nov. 21 at her home in Brooklyn, N.Y. She was 61.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Mailer had been contending for a decade with gastrointestinal cancer and
had undergone numerous surgeries and extensive treatments.
</P>
<P>
In her 20s, divorced and the mother of a small child, she was an art teacher in
Arkansas when she met Norman Mailer. They married in 1980, and through her
celebrated husband she met Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Imelda Marcos, Woody
Allen and Fidel Castro, among others.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Mrs. Mailer demonstrated the emotional resources to organize her
husband's often-tempestuous life, defend his reputation and withstand his
critiques of her work as well as to combat the debilitation of disease.
</P>
<P>
In addition to dealing with the routine challenges of living with the oft-
married literary lion and his many offspring, she overcame the devastation of
discovering that after years together he had been straying from the path of
monogamy.
</P>
<P>
That was just one of the events that made it plausible that, after two novels,
she could produce "A Ticket to the Circus," an evocatively named 2010 memoir
that could be considered worthy of a place among the chronicles of American life
and lives.
</P>
<P>
Her husband, who died in 2007, was inevitably a part of the book, but reviewers
noted that it was about her, and the fascinations of her life, which included
youthful employment in a pickle factory and a later romance with an Arkansas
politician named Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Its charms were seen as those of the granddaughter of sharecroppers who
flourished in a more glamorous world and who, when asked which of her husband's
many wives she was, had the wit and grit to reply: "The last one."
</P>
<P>
A review in The Washington Post described the memoir as the story of "a girl on
her own who took a big chance." She made her way, at least partly, according to
the review, as "the perfect combination of sex symbol and gangly good friend."
</P>
<P>
Although her family was from Arkansas, she was born in Washington state, where
her father was working on a construction project. Her birth name was Barbara
Jean Davis, and her birth date was Jan. 31, 1949. Norman Mailer was born the
same day 26 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
Religion played a major role in her upbringing in Atkins, Ark. Her middle name,
Church, was given to her by Mailer in recognition of that. Norris was the
surname of her first husband, Larry Norris.
</P>
<P>
In 1975, she was teaching art and Mailer had come to Russellville, Ark., while
promoting his new book on Marilyn Monroe. She had a copy and decided to get it
signed.
</P>
<P>
Described by a reader of her memoir as an "intelligent bombshell," she attracted
the then-married author almost instantly. She said that she found him "just the
most interesting person I've ever met."
</P>
<P>
They may have seemed an unlikely couple, but, she said, "you really can't pick
who you're attracted to."
</P>
<P>
Somehow, she said, "it worked out."
</P>
<P>
From his earlier wives, Mailer had seven children. She had one by her first
husband, and she and Mailer had a son together, John Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
When her children were grown, she began to write. She showed her husband a
100-page effort. He "said it wasn't good," she told an interviewer, but "I just
kept at it. I wasn't a slave to his opinion."
</P>
<P>
When she criticized his work, he would yell. But she stood her ground. "He had
to be the best writer in the world," she said. "I didn't see it as a contest."
</P>
<P>
She wrote two novels, "Windchill Summer" (2000) and "Cheap Diamonds" (2007).
</P>
<P>
A severe test came after they had been together for 16 years and she learned
that he had been unfaithful. "But it's not so easy," she later said, "to leave
an entire life to go to - what?"
</P>
<P>
Even more important, she said, he asked her to forgive him, with such sincerity
"that I did."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the children and stepchildren, Mrs. Mailer is survived by her
mother.
</P>
<P>
It had been a wonderful life, living with her celebrated novelist husband, Mrs.
Mailer said this year. They had been together for more than 30 years. Yet as a
widow she could think of compensations for being on her own.
</P>
<P>
"Now," she told an interviewer for the Los Angeles Times, "I don't have to fight
for the TV clicker."
