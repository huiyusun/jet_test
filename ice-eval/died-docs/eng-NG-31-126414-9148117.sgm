Has anyone else noticed a slowdown in Xfce's Terminal after the Xorg 7.3
ugprade?  In particular, now there's a noticeable delay after clicking a
maximize button, and text scrolling is jerky.

Other applications seem to be fine, it's just Terminal.

'Just tried this with terminal 0.2.6.  No problems of the sort you

Drag-resizing seems to be really, really slow.  Maybe something to do
with my old Matrox G450 video card, although it seems like it would
affect other applications.

I just tried that too - 'seemed to be OK.  I am running an Intel mobo
with onboard graphics but I've never gotten the driver to work. So,
I use VESA which seems fine (this machine is primarily a server so I
don't care that much).  Try the VESA driver and see if the behavior
changes...

Same here. Using gentoo on 3 different machines, different graphic
cards (from really old to very fast), it is the same. gnome-terminal
works fast, as before (they share vte).
Besides, after upgrading to xorg 7.3 it seems like xfce is missing
some key events - sometimes it takes two or three times to logout - it
just swallows logout requests.

It seems to be known problem, see http://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2818
.
Disable composite extension in xorg.conf (or apply patch) and problem
dissappears.

Thanks for posting this!  My google groups killfile prevented me from
seeing it here.  I actually found it on a web search.
