<P>
American student Amanda Knox exuded confidence Friday as she rejected charges
that she helped kill her British housemate after group sex play turned violent
in an Italian university town.
</P>
<P>
Accusing police of hitting and bullying her to force her to make false
statements, Knox said she had spent the night of the November 2007 sex-murder at
the home of her Italian boyfriend of two weeks, Raffaele Sollicito.
</P>
<P>
"The declarations were taken against my will," said Knox, 21, taking the stand
for the first time since the trial began in January, asserting that her
interrogators repeatedly called her a "stupid liar."
</P>
<P>
"Everything I said was said in confusion and under pressure and because they
were suggested by the (investigators)," she added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether police had hit her before she stated that the victim, Meredith
"Mez" Kercher of Coulsdon, England, had been raped, she replied "yes."
</P>
<P>
Knox also said harsh questioning had pushed her to state that she was at home at
the time of the murder and could hear Kercher scream, and to accuse her part-
time boss of the crime.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Knox said Friday, she spent the night with Sollecito at his flat, where
they smoked marijuana, had sex and watched a movie.
</P>
<P>
The two, who face 30 years in prison if convicted, have been held since a few
days after Kercher was found semi-nude with her throat cut in the house in the
walled medieval town of Perugia that she shared with Knox.
</P>
<P>
The lurid headlines in Britain and Knox's hometown of Seattle, Washington,
sparked fears that she would not have a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that the 22-year-old victim was murdered after refusing to
join in an orgy on the night of November 1, 2007, along with 20-year-old Rudy
Guede, from Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
While claiming innocence, Guede, who worked as a casual labourer here, opted for
a "fast-track" trial and has already been convicted and sentenced to 30 years
for his role in the murder.
</P>
<P>
In the prosecutors' scenario, Guede held Kercher down while Sollecito and Knox
stabbed her.
</P>
<P>
Guede was quoted in Friday's Italian press as saying from his prison cell: "You
were there, Amanda, tell the truth."
</P>
<P>
Testifying in a clear, confident voice in fluent Italian, sometimes laughing or
gesticulating, Knox explained her nickname "Foxy Knoxy" as a reference to her
skill at football, which she said she had played since she was a child.
</P>
<P>
Knox, dressed in white with her hair pulled back in a ponytail, said her
relationship with Sollecito was "very special," and that she had fallen in love
with him just two weeks before the murder.
</P>
<P>
Asked about a red area on her neck shown widely in newspaper close-ups after her
arrest, she laughed and said it was a "hickey, a love bite from Raffaele."
</P>
<P>
Knox said her questioners had led her to accuse bar owner and musician Patrick
Lumumba, for whom she worked twice a week, of murdering Kercher.
</P>
<P>
"In my confusion I started to imagine that maybe I was traumatised, like what
they said," she told Lumumba's lawyer Carlo Pacelli.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese Lumumba, who was held for two weeks before being released without
charge, is suing Knox for defamation and was present at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
The defendant said she was "very sorry, gutted, (when she learned) that Patrick
was still in jail because of me."
</P>
<P>
Pacelli later told AFP: "She is a very good actress."
</P>
<P>
Knox's early statement that she covered her ears so as not to hear Meredith's
screams "was true," Pacelli said, insisting that her questioners could not have
suggested that scenario.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Knox said that when she heard that Guede was arrested, "I thought
they would let me go... I felt great relief, but then they kept me in custody."
</P>
<P>
Kercher's family are seeking 30 million euros (40 million dollars) from the
alleged killers.
</P>
<P>
Their lawyer Francesco Maresca dismissed assertions of a bungled investigation,
telling AFP: "The probe was perfect, very good work."
</P>
<P>
He was confident of a conviction in the long-running trial. "All the necessary
elements are in place to arrive at a conviction... probably in October."
</P>
<P>
Both Kercher and Knox had arrived in the normally quiet Umbrian university town
in September 2007.
