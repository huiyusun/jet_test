Aiming to become the first man in 84 years to win the US Open six years running
and will once again start a strong favourite. Federer has had a remarkable year
to date. He lost to Rafael Nadal in the Australian Open final and failed to win
a tournament in the first five months of the year before completing his career
Grand Slam in the French Open and regaining his Wimbledon crown. He is back to
the world number one spot and won the Cincinnati Masters last week.

Winner of a season-best five titles this year, Murray has ended the four-year
long Federer-Nadal domination of the top two world ranking spots and the belief
is widespread that he is ready to win his first Grand Slam title. Made the final
here last year but was swept aside in straight sets by a rampant Federer. Has
made more progress since then especially in terms of fitness and has an
impressive 6-3 winning record against the Swiss star.

RAFAEL NADAL (ESP)
</P>
<P>
World ranking 3

Best US Open result: Semi-finals 2008
</P>
<P>
Nadal's season has been in stark contrast to that of Federer. Dominant at the
start of the year when he won his first Australian Open, the Spaniard paid the
price for his physical exertions when he lost for the first time at Roland
Garros going down to eventual finalist Robin Soderling. He then took 10 weeks
out to heal his aching knees and has been less than convincing on his return to
action. Needs a US Open title to become just the seventh man to win all four
Grand Slam titles.

After a breakthrough season in 2008 when he won his first Grand Slam title in
Melbourne and rose to number three in the world rankings, Djokovic has had a
steady if unspectacular year in 2009. Has failed to make it past the quarter-
finals in any of the Grand Slam tournaments, but won in Dubai and took Nadal to
the limit on clay in Madrid. Reached the final at the US Open in 2007 where he
lost in straight sets to Federer.

Credits his marriage and a healthier diet for improving his mobility about the
court this year. Played well on clay at the French Open and then produced his
best display in years to reach the Wimbledon final where he took Federer to a
marathon five sets before losing. Lost twice to Juan Martin del Potro in the
buildup to New York. Lost to Federer in four sets in the US Open final in 2006

The giant Argentinian is the youngest player currently in the top 10 and his
progress has been spectacular over the last year. Took Federer to the limit in
the French Open semi-final before losing in the Wimbledon second round to
Lleyton Hewitt. Won the Washington tournament earlier this month to underline
his threat, but fitness let him down in the Montreal Masters against Murray and
that could tell against him in New York where he lost in the quarter-finals last
year.

Best US Open result: Third round 2007, 08
</P>

The Frenchman won two tiles early in the year but failed to get past the fourth
round at either the French Open or Wimbledon. Has blown hot and cold in the
buildup to Flushing Meadows losing early in Washington before reaching the semi-
finals at the Montreal Masters where he lost a close one to Andy Murray. Tsonga
has yet to make it past the third round at the US Open but he was the junior
champion in New York in 2003 and loves the big occasion.

<P>
Stepped up a level at the start of the year with a run to the Australian Open
semi-finals where he took Nadal all the way before losing in five sets. Lost in
the fourth round at the French Open and Wimbledon and struggled since then until
the Montreal Masters where he was unlucky to lose to Roddick in a top quality
third round tie. Could be running into form at the right time for New York
