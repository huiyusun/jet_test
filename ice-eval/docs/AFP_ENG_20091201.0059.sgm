A flirtatious gesture by US student Amanda Knox caught an investigator's eye and
changed the course of the probe into the 2007 sex murder of her housemate, a
defence lawyer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Without the famous come-on... she wouldn't be here today" standing trial for
the slaying of Briton Meredith Kercher, said Carlo Dalla Vedova.
</P>
<P>
Investigators say that the day after the gruesome murder of 21-year-old Kercher,
Knox swivelled her hips suggestively while donning anti-contamination shoe-
covers at the scene of the crime.
</P>
<P>
Presenting closing arguments just three days ahead of the expected verdict in
the sensational trial, Dalla Vedova said the media frenzy it sparked had
vilified Knox and invaded her privacy.
</P>
<P>
Raising his voice, Dalla Vedova said: "Amanda is a wholesome young woman!"
</P>
<P>
Knox, 22, dressed in black with her hair pulled back in a single French braid,
listened impassively as her parents Curt Knox and Edda Mellas, seated behind
her, followed proceedings with the help of an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
Curt Knox told reporters afterward that Dalla Vedova's summing up was "another
step in the right direction," the ANSA news agency reported. "We hope to take
another step forward tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
The defence will complete its closing arguments on Wednesday, with rebuttals
scheduled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Knox and her co-defendant, former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 25, have been in
custody since a few days after the murder of the 21-year-old exchange student
from Coulsdon, south of London, on November 1, 2007.
</P>
<P>
Kercher, an aspiring teacher, was found semi-nude with multiple stab wounds to
her neck in her bedroom the following morning.
</P>
<P>
She and Knox, both students at Perugia's prestigious University for Foreigners,
shared a cottage in the hilltop Umbrian city with two Italian women who were
away for the holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Kercher refused to join in a drug-fuelled sex game in which Knox
was the driving force, conducting a "crescendo of violence" that led to
Kercher's brutal death.
</P>
<P>
They have said DNA and other forensic evidence incriminate Knox and Sollecito
and have requested life sentences for the pair.
</P>
<P>
The slaying dented the university's reputation, while residents are eager for
the end of the trial, which began in January.
</P>
<P>
"It has caused real chaos," one student told AFP.
</P>
<P>
She was among a dozen students around a long table at a pizzeria in the centre
of the medieval walled city who said she thought Knox was guilty. Another three
said she was innocent, while one abstained from the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
The defence argued Monday that all evidence pointed to a sole killer, Rudy
Guede, an Ivorian immigrant convicted separately of the grisly crime in a so-
called "fast-track" trial limited to evidence from the probe.
</P>
<P>
Kercher's family is seeking 25 million euros (37 million dollars) in damages
from Knox, Sollecito and Guede.
</P>
<P>
Knox also faces a defamation suit from her former employer, Congolese bar owner
Patrick Lumumba, who was held for two weeks after she accused him under
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
Knox charged that aggressive police questioning led her to accuse Lumumba of the
murder.
</P>
<P>
Dalla Vedova noted Tuesday that the Italian state had already paid damages of
8,000 euros to Lumumba, and that Knox had said "'I'm sorry' so many times, and
'I don't know how I can look Lumumba in the eye'."
</P>
<P>
But Lumumba's lawyer Carlo Pacelli slammed the remarks, saying Knox had told her
mother, in a recorded conversation 10 days after the murder, that "she felt
terrible because she accused Patrick knowing he was innocent."
</P>
<P>
Pacelli told AFP: "But she didn't go to the police, or the magistrate or anyone
else to change her declaration."
</P>
<P>
Two judges and six jurors are expected to reach a verdict late Friday.
