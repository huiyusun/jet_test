The mother of US student Amanda Knox said Monday that she promised her daughter
that "we will fight" for her release, as the young woman began serving a 26-year
prison term for murdering her British housemate in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Edda Mellas was able to visit her jailed daughter over the weekend, hours after
Knox was convicted by two judges and six Italian jurors of murdering British
exchange student Meredith Kercher in the cottage the two young women shared in
Perugia, Mellas said in an interview with US television.
</P>
<P>
"You will get out of here. Don't worry. Keep your chin up and have courage,"
Mellas said she told her 22-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
"We need to be strong for Amanda. We will fight for her and she will get out of
here," Mellas told ABC television.
</P>
<P>
Knox's family was present when the verdict was read out, but not speaking
Italian, they were able to glean only from the reaction of others in the Perugia
courtroom that the young woman had been found guilty.
</P>
<P>
"I heard someone gasping in the audience, back where the public stood," Mellas
said.
</P>
<P>
"I heard, 'No, no.' Then I heard other people weeping back in the public area
and I thought, 'wow,'" said Mellas.
</P>
<P>
"And then I could see Amanda. She put her head down and she started to cry," an
emotional Mellas said.
</P>
<P>
"I cried. Some of the lawyers were crying. It was chaos," Mellas said.
</P>
<P>
Knox was sentenced last week to 26 years in jail and co-defendant Raffaele
Sollecito, her new boyfriend at the time of the murder two years ago, received a
sentence of 25 years for their roles in Kercher's murder.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors presented DNA and other forensic evidence against Knox, Sollecito
and a third person, Rudy Guede of Ivory Coast, who was convicted separately
after opting for a "fast-track" trial in exchange for clemency.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleged that the three young people were high on drugs when they
tried to engage Kercher, 21, in a sex game that turned violent, leaving her dead
with stab wounds to the neck.
</P>
<P>
Knox's family has vowed to appeal the verdict.
</P>
<P>
"We will do whatever it takes to support Amanda," her mother said.
</P>
<P>
"All over the world -- and this isn't just Italy, it's the United States, it's
everywhere -- truly innocent people are found guilty, and this is one of those
cases. She's innocent," Mellas said.
