<P>
The trial of a former top Chinese official accused of gangster links, rape and
taking bribes ended Sunday, the court said, bringing to a close the highest-
profile case yet of a huge mafia crackdown.
</P>
<P>
A verdict on the case of Wen Qiang, former justice department director in the
southwestern city of Chongqing, would be announced at an undisclosed, later
date, the No. 5 Intermediate People's Court said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Wen, 54, is the highest-ranking official to appear in the dock in a string of
prosecutions over corruption and mafia crime in the sprawling city that has
gripped the nation with lurid details of sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
At least nine people have been reported executed or sentenced to death in the
trials, which have shocked the public by exposing the impunity enjoyed by mafia
kingpins as they terrorised Chongqing and lived debauched lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
Wen, who was also once a top police official in the city, has been charged with
accepting more than two million dollars in bribes, protecting mafia rings and
four counts of rape, a previous court statement said.
</P>
<P>
The trial began on Tuesday and ended in the early hours of Sunday after hours of
legal sparring.
</P>
<P>
Evidence and testimony related to the allegations of bribery and mafia
protection were heard in open court, but the section devoted to the rape charges
took place behind closed doors, the court statement said.
</P>
<P>
Wen was on trial with four other people, including his wife.
</P>
<P>
A report by the official Xinhua news agency said Wen's lawyer rejected a lot of
the evidence pertaining to alleged bribe-taking, and had pleaded not guilty to
his client protecting mafia rings.
</P>
<P>
According to the China News Service, Wen said in court that much of the money he
received was New Year or birthday gifts. He also denied providing any help to
mafia groups.
</P>
<P>
According to the state-run Beijing News, Wen's lawyer has said a verdict will be
announced after the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, which kicks off on February
13 and ends six days later.
</P>
<P>
In November, Wen's sister-in-law Xie Caiping was sentenced to 18 years in prison
on charges of running illegal gambling dens and drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
She reportedly drove a Mercedes-Benz, owned several luxury villas and kept a
stable of 16 young men to provide her with sexual services.
