The parents of American Amanda Knox, convicted in the 2007 murder of her British
housemate in Italy, Friday launched an appeal after the judge spelt out his
reasons for sending her to jail for 26 years.
</P>
<P>
"There is a substantial basis for the appeal and we have faith that this will
bring about a reversal of a wrongful conviction," Edda Mellas and Curt Knox said
in a statement carried by the ANSA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Judge Giancarlo Massei said in a legal opinion published Thursday that evidence
presented during the year-long trial gave a "comprehensive and solid picture,
without gaps or inconsistencies" leading to guilty verdicts for Knox and her
then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito.
</P>
<P>
The sensational sex-murder of Briton Meredith Kercher was carried out "with no
planning, no animosity or rancour against the victim," Massei wrote in the
427-page opinion issued three months after the verdict and also signed by co-
judge Beatrice Cristiani.
</P>
<P>
Mellas and Knox said the conviction was "not supported by evidence," and that
the opinion contained "numerous incongrouences and contradictions."
</P>
<P>
"We know our daughter is innocent," they added.
</P>
<P>
"There is no scientific proof that places Amanda in Meredith's room, no proof
that she was on the scene of this terrible crime," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Knox family lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova said Thursday the opinion was "full of
contradictions and unproven assertions."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to AFP by telephone from Perugia, he said: "We are still analysing
it... (but) we will contest the illogical elements," he said, calling for new
scientific tests.
</P>
<P>
Knox, now 22, and Sollecito, an Italian engineering student who is now 25, were
convicted of murdering Kercher, 21, in a drug-fueled sex game that turned
violent on the night of November 1, 2007, in the central university town of
Perugia.
</P>
<P>
A third person, Rudy Guede of Ivory Coast, now 23, had already been convicted
separately in the case under a "fast-track" procedure.
</P>
<P>
Kercher was found semi-nude in a pool of blood under a duvet with multiple stab
wounds to the neck in her room in the cottage she shared with Knox and two other
women, who were away for the long All Saints Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
The crime came about because of a combination of "purely random" circumstances,
notably that both Knox and Sollecito were free that evening, they "ran into"
Guede and went to the house where Kercher was alone, it said.
</P>
<P>
The opinion also asserted that Knox "freely accused Patrick Diya Lumumba of
having killed Meredith and accused him knowing of (his) innocence".
</P>
<P>
Knox was sentenced to 26 years in jail, while Sollecito got 25.
</P>
<P>
The extra year for Knox was in punishment for defaming Lumumba, who spent two
weeks in prison before being released without charge.
</P>
<P>
The Italian court came under harsh criticism from many who felt Knox, a native
of Seattle, Washington, was convicted only on circumstantial evidence and that
the Italian press, which jurors were free to read, had assassinated her
character.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic furore arose after the verdict prompted a senator from Washington
state to charge that Italy's judicial system was "flawed".
</P>
<P>
Knox herself later told a visiting Italian lawmaker that she felt her "rights
were respected" in the trial and that it was "carried out correctly".
