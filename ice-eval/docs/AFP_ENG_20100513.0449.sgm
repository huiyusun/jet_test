A Dutch boy who miraculously survived a Libyan plane crash that killed 103
people including his parents is confused but stable, a doctor said Thursday, as
relatives arrived in Tripoli to comfort him.
</P>
<P>
The boy, identified only as "Ruben" by the Dutch foreign ministry but more fully
named by the Dutch media as nine-year-old Ruben van Assouw, has come round after
surgery to his smashed legs, the doctor treating him in a Tripoli hospital said.
</P>
<P>
"He woke up (late Wednesday night) and is in good condition," the doctor said,
while stressing that the boy was confused and "still is not reacting well to his
surroundings."
</P>
<P>
"The child underwent several rounds of surgery to his legs. He had simple
fractures and double fractures," the doctor said on Libyan state television,
which also showed pictures of the boy's legs in casts.
</P>
<P>
A Dutch foreign ministry spokesman said an uncle and an aunt arrived in Tripoli
Thursday on a Netherlands government plane and were taken to the hospital "to
make sure that Ruben will see family faces next to his bed."
</P>
<P>
The boy would be flown back home "as soon as his medical condition allows," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Christoph Prommersberger told AFP that the boy was doing
"reasonably well."
</P>
<P>
"A colleague from the embassy (in Tripoli) was able to speak with him. He told
her he was Ruben, nine years old, from the city of Tilburg," Prommersberger
said. "He is not in a critical condition."
</P>
<P>
Dutch newspaper Babants Dagblad said the boy was likely Ruben van Assouw from
Tilburg in the southern Netherlands who had been on safari in South Africa with
his mother Trudy, 41, father Patrick, 40, and his brother Enzo, 11.
</P>
<P>
Also on board the Dutch government plane to Tripoli were forensic experts,
consular staff and transport ministry staff, the foreign ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Libya's Transport Minister Mohammed Ali Zidan said a total of 103 people -- 92
passengers of nine nationalities and an 11-strong Libyan crew -- died when an
Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330 coming from Johannesburg disintegrated on landing
at Tripoli airport.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch foreign ministry said on Thursday that 70 Dutch nationals were among
the dead, while a diplomat said family members from the Netherlands have been
flown in to Libya courtesy of Afriqiyah to identify the bodies and prepare their
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Johannesburg private Talk Radio 702 reported on Thursday that at least 10 South
Africans died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
Libya's transport minister said the rest of the dead included two Germans as
well as passengers from Britain, France, Finland, the Philippines and Zimbabwe,
although he could not give a breakdown of their numbers.
</P>
<P>
With the plane's black boxes recovered, investigators from manufacturers Airbus
and France where the plane was built have also flown to join the inquiry led by
Libya, which has ruled out terrorism as the cause of Wednesday's crash.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses spoke of the aircraft inexplicably breaking up as it came in to land
in clear weather.
</P>
<P>
"It is too soon to know the causes of the accident," Sabri Shadi, the chairman
of the board of Afriqiyah Airways, said about the probe into the crash.
</P>
<P>
"Several committees have been set up to investigate and we need some time before
we can draw any conclusions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A preliminary report should be published in the next few days but definitive
results will not be know for several days, even weeks," the chairman added.
</P>
<P>
Shadi said that after a first meeting which grouped the team that US
investigators were to join the probe on Friday. The crash scene, meanwhile, has
been placed under police guard.
</P>
<P>
Libyan authorities said they were prepared to offer all assistance, granting
full access to its airport operations.
