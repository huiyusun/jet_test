Prosecutors asked Thursday for a six-month prison term for US missionary Laura
Silsby, who was arrested trying to leave Haiti with 33 children following the
devastating January earthquake that hit the country.
</P>
<P>
Silsby was described as the leader of a group of 10 US Baptists stopped at the
border with the Dominican Republic with the children who were purported to be
orphans.
</P>
<P>
Although she was initially accused of child abduction, the charges were later
revised to "irregular travel."
</P>
<P>
A verdict in the case is expected within a few days, judicial officials said.
</P>
<P>
Silsby and her fellow Baptist missionaries were arrested on January 29 as they
tried to take the children into the neighboring Dominican Republic by bus
without the necessary documentation.
</P>
<P>
The members of the New Life Children's Refuge missionary group denied
wrongdoing, saying they were only trying to help orphans in the wake of Haiti's
devastating January 12 earthquake that killed more than 250,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Haitian authorities later determined that all 33 children that the US
missionaries tried to remove from the country had parents, with whom they were
eventually reunited.
</P>
<P>
Silsby's defense lawyer Jean Renel Tessier argued that Silsby should not be
convicted on the charges "because the border with the Dominican Republic was
open."
</P>
<P>
The other nine missionaries arrested were all released and allowed to return to
the United States, but Silsby, the leader of the group, remained detained in
Port-au-Prince.
