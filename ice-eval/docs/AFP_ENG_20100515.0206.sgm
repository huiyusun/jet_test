Nine-year-old Ruben van Assouw, the sole survivor of a Libyan airliner crash,
arrived back home in the Netherlands on Saturday, three days after the disaster
that killed his parents, brother and 100 others, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"The plane with the surviving boy has landed" at the Eindhoven military air
base, spokesman Markus van Tol of the Dutch tourism federation ANWB told AFP, as
reports said Ruben was then transferred to an ambulance with blacked out windows
and taken to an undisclosed hospital.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by an uncle and aunt and the Libyan doctor who had been treating
him, the air ambulance transporting the boy landed around 2:15 pm (1215 GMT),
according to Dutch news agency ANP.
</P>
<P>
The flight had left from Matiga military airfield in the Libyan capital about
three hours earlier, with every effort being made to hide the boy from the sight
of journalists, photographers and onlookers on both ends.
</P>
<P>
"He's a very special patient. He is talking and in good health. I will stay (in
the Netherlands) for as long as necessary," Dr Siddiq ben Dilla told AFP before
the Cessna Citation air ambulance took off from Libya.
</P>
<P>
Police prevented photographers from approaching as Ruben was taken from hospital
by stretcher, covered in a blue blanket and with a black cap on his head and
scarf covering his face, to the ambulance for the journey to the airport.
</P>
<P>
Upon landing, the boy identified by the foreign ministry only as Ruben from
Tilburg in the southern Netherlands and more fully as Ruben van Assouw by Dutch
media, was taken by ambulance with two doctors and a nurse to hospital.
</P>
<P>
About an hour after landing at Eindhoven, the foreign ministry said "Ruben has
arrived safely at his final destination", which it declined to specify.
</P>
<P>
"This concludes the news about Ruben," foreign ministry spokesman Christoph
Prommersberger told AFP. "There won't be any more information, any more
updates."
</P>
<P>
The Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330 flight from Johannesburg in South Africa
disintegrated on landing. Officials said 70 Dutch citizens were among the 103
people killed, although Afriqiyah Airways said there were 67 Dutch on board,
including Ruben.
</P>
<P>
The boy was found alive, strapped into his seat at the accident site.
</P>
<P>
A commission of inquiry said Saturday that the plane did not catch fire before
hitting the ground.
</P>
<P>
"We have not found debris detached from the plane or evidence of fire before the
accident," commission chief Neji Dhaou was quoted as saying by official news
agency JANA.
</P>
<P>
"The fire broke out 400 metres (yards) from the initial impact with the ground."
</P>
<P>
Ruben himself has told a Dutch newspaper he could remember nothing about the
crash.
</P>
<P>
"I am fine, but my legs hurt a lot," he said in a telephone interview published
Friday, adding: "I really want to go home."
</P>
<P>
Ruben's aunt and uncle said on Friday the boy was now aware that his mother,
father and 11-year-old brother died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
"We have explained to Ruben exactly what happened. He knows that his parents and
his brother are dead," they said in a statement read to media in Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
"The time ahead will be a difficult period for us," the statement said. "We hope
that the media will respect our privacy."
