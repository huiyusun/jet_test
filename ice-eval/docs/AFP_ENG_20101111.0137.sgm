A Pakistani court has sentenced to death a Christian mother of five for
blasphemy, the first such conviction of a woman and sparking protests from
rights groups Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Asia Bibi, 45, was sentenced Monday by a local court in Nankana district in
Pakistan's central province Punjab, about 75 kilometres (47 miles) west of the
country's cultural capital of Lahore.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has yet to execute anyone for blasphemy, but the case spotlights the
Muslim country's controversial laws on the subject which rights activists say
encourages Islamist extremism in a nation wracked by Taliban attacks.
</P>
<P>
Asia's case dates back to June 2009 when she was asked to fetch water while out
working in the fields. But a group of Muslim women labourers objected, saying
that as a non-Muslim, she should not touch the water bowl.
</P>
<P>
A few days later the women went to a local cleric and alleged that Asia made
made derogatory remarks about the Prophet Mohammed. The cleric went to local
police, who opened an investigation.
</P>
<P>
She was arrested in Ittanwalai village and prosecuted under Section 295 C of the
Pakistan Penal Code, which carries the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Sentencing her to hang, Judge Naveed Iqbal "totally ruled out" any chance that
Asia was falsely implicated and said there were "no mitigating circumstances",
according to a copy of the verdict seen by AFP.
</P>
<P>
Husband Ashiq Masih, 51, told AFP that he would appeal her death sentence, which
needs to be upheld by the Lahore high court, the highest tribunal in Punjab,
before it can be carried out.
</P>
<P>
"The case is baseless and we will file an appeal," he said.
</P>
<P>
The couple have two sons and three daughters.
</P>
<P>
Rights activists and minority pressure groups said it was the first time that a
woman had been sentenced to hang in Pakistan for blasphemy, although a Muslim
couple were jailed for life last year.
</P>
<P>
Human rights activists want the controversial legislation repealed, saying it is
exploited for personal enmity and encourages Islamist extremism.
</P>
<P>
"The blasphemy law is absolutely obscene and it needs to be repealed in
totality," Human Rights Watch spokesman Ali Dayan Hasan told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"It is primarily used against vulnerable groups that face social and political
discrimination. Heading that category are religious minorities and heterodox
Muslim sects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Asia's case at a press conference in Islamabad on Thursday, visiting
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said he was unaware of the details but
would raise the matter with Pakistan's minorities minister.
</P>
<P>
"The Italian position has always been against the death penalty," he told
reporters. He said he raised the problems faced by Christian minorities during
his talks with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi.
</P>
<P>
"I believe they should not misuse the law of blasphemy to discriminate against
religious minorities and this is a point I share with my colleague -- this is a
key point for me."
</P>
<P>
Around three percent of Pakistan's population of 167 million is estimated to be
non-Muslim.
</P>
<P>
Last July, two Christian brothers accused of writing a blasphemous pamphlet
critical of the Prophet Mohammed were shot dead outside a court in Punjab.
</P>
<P>
Pastor Rashid Emmanuel, 32, and his brother Sajjad, were killed as they left a
court hearing in Faisalabad city, where hundreds of Muslim protesters had
demanded they be sentenced to death.
