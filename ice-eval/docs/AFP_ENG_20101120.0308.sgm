A top Pakistan government official Saturday backed a Christian mother's appeal
against a death sentence for blasphemy, saying he hoped President Asif Ali
Zardari would pardon her.
</P>
<P>
Asia Bibi was sentenced to hang in Pakistan's central province of Punjab earlier
this month after being accused of insulting the Prophet Mohammed in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Punjab governor Salman Taseer met Bibi in prison and told a televised press
conference afterwards that he would personally pass on her request for clemency.
</P>
<P>
"I will soon meet President Asif Ali Zardari and hand him over Bibi's appeal,"
he said. "I hope that the president will pardon her."
</P>
<P>
The contents of the appeal were not immediately known, but Taseer said he was
supporting it on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has yet to execute anyone for blasphemy, but the case spotlights a
controversial law which rights activists say encourages Islamist extremism in a
Muslim country on the front line of the US-led war on Al-Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
Pope Benedict XVI this week called for Bibi's release and said Christians in
Pakistan were "often victims of violence and discrimination."
</P>
<P>
Minister for minority affairs Shahbaz Bhatti earlier this week asked the Punjab
government for a thorough re-investigation and a fair appeal hearing for the
mother of five.
</P>
<P>
At the Lahore high court, the top court in Punjab, Bibi has filed a separate
appeal against her conviction.
</P>
<P>
Her lawyer S.K. Chaudhry said the court would take up the case next week.
</P>
<P>
In June 2009, Bibi was asked to fetch water while out working in the fields. But
Muslim women labourers objected, saying that as a non-Muslim, she should not
touch the water bowl.
</P>
<P>
Bibi was later arrested by police and prosecuted under the Pakistan Penal Code
on a complaint by Muslim women that she made derogatory remarks about the
Prophet Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Rights activists and minority pressure groups said it was the first time that a
woman had been sentenced to hang in Pakistan for blasphemy, although a Muslim
couple were jailed for life last year.
</P>
<P>
Only around three percent of Pakistan's population of 167 million are estimated
to be non-Muslim.
