An American student accused in the 2007 killing of her British roommate in Italy has taken the stand for a second day.

Wearing jeans and a white blouse, Amanda Knox of Seattle is being crossed-examined by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
She is on trial in the central town of Perugia together with ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito in the slaying of 21-year-old Meredith Kercher.
</P>
<P>
Knox took the stand for the first time Friday, saying she spent the night of the killing at Sollecito's apartment, in contrast with prosecutors, who say Kercher was killed in what began as a sex game.
</P>
<P>
Knox claimed police beat her into making a false statement and prosecutor Giuliano Mignini began Saturday's session by questioning her on the allegations.
