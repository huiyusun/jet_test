A gunman who fired dozens of shots into a fitness center exercise class, killing three women and injuring nine, was a 48-year-old man from suburban Pittsburgh.

A person close to the Allegheny County coroner's office says the gunman was George Sodini who lived in Carnegie, just a few miles from the health club. The person wasn't authorized to comment on the gunman's identity and spoke on condition of anonymity.

<P>
In a Web site posted under his name, Sodini wrote rambling messages about his hatred of women and how he was tired of being rejected by them. He ended by writing, "Death Lives!"

After shooting the women Tuesday night the gunman turned the gun on himself.
