U.S. captain Christie Rampone served as player-coach as the New Jersey-based team qualified for the playoffs and advanced. With a baby due in March, she probably won't return to the field as a player until June.

Miettinen had coached in the Finnish Premier League. She also worked at Florida State University when that team reached the 2005 U.S. college semifinals.
