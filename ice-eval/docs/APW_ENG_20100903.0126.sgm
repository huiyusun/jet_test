<P>
Forecasters say Hurricane Earl is weakening as it passes over North Carolina's Outer Banks but is still packing powerful winds as it heads up the Eastern Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
The National Hurricane Center says Earl's winds are now at about 105 mph (168 kph). A new tropical storm warning has been issued for New England from the coasts of Massachusetts to Maine.
</P>
<P>
Gusts above 40 mph (64 kph) made signs shake and the heavy rain fall sideways in Buxton, the southeasternmost tip of the Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
North Carolina is the first and potentially most destructive stop on the storm's projected journey up the Eastern Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
Earl's eye is some 100 miles (160 kilometers) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras but isn't expected to make landfall until perhaps western Nova Scotia, Canada, in the next few days.
