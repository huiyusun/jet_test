A chef who described "overwhelming" personal debt when he was featured on Gordon Ramsay's "Kitchen Nightmares" show jumped to his death from a bridge.
</P>
<P>
The body of 39-year-old Joseph Cerniglia was found floating in the Hudson River on Friday. Grace Burgess, a spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner's office, said the office on Tuesday ruled Cerniglia's death a suicide. Authorities said he jumped from the George Washington Bridge, which connects New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Cerniglia owned Campania in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, which he bought in 2006. In 2007, the debt-ridden Italian restaurant was featured on Ramsay's show.
</P>
<P>
During the broadcast, Cerniglia estimated he owed purveyors about $80,000.
</P>
<P>
"I'm financially in trouble. The debt of the restaurant alone is overwhelming," he said. "My personal debt -- wife, kids, mortgage -- that's a lot of debt."
</P>
<P>
His wife added, "If this business fails, we will lose everything."
</P>
<P>
"Why did you become a chef-owner if you haven't a clue how to run a business?" Ramsay asks him on the show.
</P>
<P>
A self-taught chef, Cerniglia worked for the famed New York-based Gallagher's Steakhouse chain for a decade, where he became the executive chef.
</P>
<P>
Jim Edwards, the culinary director at Chef Central in Paramus, was a close friend for the last seven years. He last saw Cerniglia three weeks ago and said he seemed his cheerful self.
</P>
<P>
"He never gave the outward appearance that there was anything bothering him," Edwards said. "He was always very creative and upbeat. He had a very infectious smile and a way of making you feel at home.
</P>
<P>
"It's very tragic, whatever it was he couldn't overcome," Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
Edwards said his friend benefited from being on Ramsay's show and said he thought it portrayed him in a favorable light overall.
</P>
<P>
"I thought he fared well," Edwards said. "I was never at the restaurant when it wasn't packed."
</P>
<P>
Cerniglia is the second former contestant on a Ramsay television show to commit suicide. The other was a former contestant on the British celebrity chef's "Hell's Kitchen" chef competition.
</P>
<P>
Calls and e-mails sent to Ramsay's publicist in London were not immediately returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cerniglia leaves behind his wife and three sons, ages 13, 11 and 9.
</P>
<P>
The family is holding a private funeral service on Wednesday for Cerniglia in Wayne, where he grew up. Relatives declined to talk about him Tuesday when reached by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
In his obituary, his family spoke positively about the show: "He was honored to have his restaurant featured on an episode of 'Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares' and the television experience was thrilling for him."
