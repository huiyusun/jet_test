<P>
A long-delayed murder trial may shed light on who ordered the decades-old killing of an American Indian Movement activist who was shot in the head and left to die on South Dakota's Pine Ridge reservation.
</P>
<P>
John Graham, a Southern Tutchone Indian from Canada and former AIM member, heads to trial on murder charges this week in South Dakota court. Prosecutors allege Graham was one of three AIM activists who kidnapped and killed Annie Mae Aquash because AIM leaders believed she was a government spy.
</P>
<P>
Aquash's death, which occurred 35 years ago next month, quickly became synonymous with the violent clashes between AIM and federal authorities in the 1970s. One person has been convicted of the murder, and another pleaded guilty this month in connection with her kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
But one of Aquash's daughters says the real story behind what happened has yet to come out.
</P>
<P>
"Each time we go to trial, it reveals more of the truth," said Denise Maloney Pictou.
</P>
<P>
Graham, 55, has maintained his innocence in the killing. His attorney, John Murphy, did not respond to requests for comment. His daughter, Naneek Graham, has declined to comment lately but said in 2007 that Aquash was "a dear friend of his."
</P>
<P>
Among those who could testify at Graham's trial are Arlo Looking Cloud, who was convicted in 2004 in connection with Aquash's murder and has said Graham pulled the trigger, and Thelma Rios, who pleaded guilty this month to being an accessory to Aquash's kidnapping and received a suspended prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
Rios was originally to go on trial with Graham. Now, her plea could prove pivotal to Graham's prosecution. In a court hearing this month, Rios said she relayed a message to AIM members in Colorado that Aquash should be taken from Denver to Rapid City, the Rapid City Journal reported. She also acknowledged hearing discussions about whether Aquash should be killed, the Journal reported.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, Rios leads to other people," said Paul DeMain, an Indian journalist who has long researched the Aquash case. "(Graham) was a young guy who was a gofer. He wanted to prove himself."
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's theory, based on court documents and witnesses, is that Graham, Looking Cloud and a third AIM member, Theda Clark, were told in late 1975 to take Aquash from Denver to Rios' apartment in Rapid City. There, she was interrogated by AIM members and allegedly raped by Graham. Aquash was driven to the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations, then killed and left in a ravine, where her body was found in February 1976.
</P>
<P>
Richard Marshall, a Rapid City man who was accused of providing a .32-caliber pistol to Graham and Clark, was acquitted of murder charges in April. Clark, who is in her 80s and lives in a Nebraska nursing home, has never been charged and refused to testify.
</P>
<P>
AIM leaders have consistently denied personal involvement in Aquash's death.
</P>
<P>
Russell Means, an early leader of AIM, has blamed Vernon Bellecourt, another group leader, for ordering the murder. He called Graham and Looking Cloud "the most vulnerable of Indian people."
</P>
<P>
"They're only picking on those, the most vulnerable, the easiest to convict, because nobody cares about them," Means said in a telephone interview. When asked whether he was involved, Means replied, "Get real."
</P>
<P>
Vernon Bellecourt denied allegations against him in a 2004 interview with The Associated Press, four years before he died. "To this day I don't know who shot Anna Mae Aquash," he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
AIM co-founder Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt's brother, did not respond to questions in a brief phone interview. Dennis Banks, another leader mentioned in previous trials, did not return a message seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
Aquash's death came six months after two FBI agents were gunned down in a shootout with AIM members on Pine Ridge, and two years after AIM's 71-day occupation of Wounded Knee, in which Aquash participated.
</P>
<P>
For years, witnesses refused to come forward. Many feared retribution from AIM or distrusted the FBI, said Norman Zigrossi, who was in charge of the FBI's Rapid City office at the time.
</P>
<P>
Theories about a cover-up abounded after the doctor who performed Aquash's first autopsy missed signs that she was murdered and concluded she died from exposure to the cold. Her body later had to be exhumed, and she was eventually buried in her native Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
"The environment was such that the Indians on Pine Ridge didn't trust us," Zigrossi said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors indicted Graham and Looking Cloud in 2003. Looking Cloud was tried and convicted the following year and given a mandatory sentence of life in prison. In testimony at Marshall's trial this year, Looking Cloud acknowledged standing nearby as Graham shot Aquash, then taking the gun from him and firing all the bullets in a different direction.
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid (he) might shoot me next," Looking Cloud said, according to a trial transcript.
</P>
<P>
Graham was arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia, and fought extradition for four years before being sent to South Dakota in December 2007.
</P>
<P>
But the federal charges against Graham were repeatedly dismissed because prosecutors couldn't prove they had the authority to charge him, as Graham and Aquash are both from Canadian tribes. State prosecutors then charged Graham with three counts of felony murder late last year.
</P>
<P>
Longtime observers of the case say Graham, as the alleged shooter, could lead authorities further.
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt that John Graham could lead to the leadership," DeMain said. "Graham going to prison for the rest of his life is not the necessary thing."
</P>
<P>
Maloney Pictou says she hopes Graham's trial will help bring justice to her family.
</P>
<P>
"This is not about sending as many people as we can to prison," she said in a phone interview. "It's about finding the truth and exposing it and taking responsibility."
