After years of delays and legal wrangling, a murder trial began Wednesday for a man accused of shooting an American Indian Movement activist 35 years ago on South Dakota's Pine Ridge reservation.
</P>
<P>
During his opening statement, South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley recounted for jurors what investigators believe happened in the three days leading up to the December 1975 slaying of Annie Mae Aquash. He told them the defendant, John Graham, 55, shot her because the activist group's leaders thought she was a government informant.
</P>
<P>
Graham's attorney, John Murphy, countered in his opening statement that the prosecution lacked a murder weapon, fingerprints or other physical evidence to link Graham with Aquash's killing or the site of her death.
</P>
<P>
Graham, a Southern Tutchone Indian from Canada, is charged with first- and second-degree murder in the slaying of Aquash, and could be sent to prison for life if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Aquash's death became synonymous with AIM and its often violent struggles with federal agents in the 1970s, and family members and observers have said Graham's trial could help to answer lingering questions about why Aquash died and who ordered her killing.
</P>
<P>
During his narrative about what the state believes happened, Jackley told jurors that Graham and two other AIM activists, Arlo Looking Cloud and Theda Clark, were told in late 1975 to take Aquash from Denver to Rapid City, to the apartment of Thelma Rios.
</P>
<P>
Looking Cloud was found guilty of his involvement in the murder in 2004 and will likely testify at Graham's trial. Rios pleaded guilty last month in connection with Aquash's kidnapping and may also testify.
</P>
<P>
Graham, Looking Cloud and Clark, according to Jackley, then took Aquash from Rapid City onto the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations. The four finally stopped near a highway on Pine Ridge, Jackley said.
</P>
<P>
"John Graham knew the task at hand and he got out of the vehicle," Jackley said.
</P>
<P>
There, Jackley told jurors, Graham shot Aquash in the back of the head as Looking Cloud stood nearby.
</P>
<P>
Jackley said witnesses would show that AIM leaders considered Aquash dangerous and that Graham later suggested that he felt remorse for the crime.
</P>
<P>
Murphy told jurors that the prosecution lacked the physical evidence to link Graham with Aquash's killing or the site of her death.
</P>
<P>
He questioned the credibility of two witnesses he said were central to the prosecution's case: Looking Cloud and Serle Chapman, a British journalist who interviewed Graham and cooperated with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
Murphy accused Looking Cloud of changing his story in the hope of having his life sentence reduced, and Chapman of lying to get money and help with immigration from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
"Simply put, I ask you to listen so you can engage how believable any of these people are," Murphy said of the prosecution's witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Aquash, a member of the Mi'kmaq tribe of Nova Scotia, was 30 when she died in late 1975. Her death came about six months after two FBI agents were gunned down in a shootout with AIM members, and two years after she participated in AIM's 71-day occupation of the South Dakota reservation town of Wounded Knee.
</P>
<P>
AIM was founded in the late 1960s to protest the U.S. government's treatment of Indians and demand the government honor its treaties with Indian tribes. It first gained national attention in 1972 when it took over the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters in Washington, but has since faded from public view.
</P>
<P>
Graham was first indicted in 2003 and extradited to South Dakota four years later to face federal murder charges. But after federal courts ruled that U.S. prosecutors didn't have authority to prosecute Graham, he was indicted in state court.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors were calling their first witnesses Wednesday afternoon.
