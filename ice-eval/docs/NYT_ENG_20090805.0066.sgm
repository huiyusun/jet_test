      EXP-NKOREA-U.S. (Washington) -- A day after former President Bill
Clinton's foray into North Korea to win the freedom of two American
journalists, the Obama administration moved quickly to send a stern
message to the North Korean regime. President Barack Obama said
Clinton's "humanitarian mission" did not ease the demands of the
United States and his allies that North Korea alter its behavior if
it wants to escape its isolation. By Mark Landler.

      EXP-SKOREA-AUTOS-RAID (Seoul, South Korea) -- South Korean police
commandos stormed a car factory using helicopters, water cannons
and tear gas in what the authorities hoped would be a final push to
evict hundreds of workers who seized the plant more than two months
ago to protest layoffs. But the workers who remained holed up in
the factory, the Ssangyong Motor Co. plant, refused to surrender,
warning that further police action could ignite thousands of liters
of paint thinner and other materials. By Choe- Sang-hun.

      EXP-DIGITAL-STATISTICIANS (Palo Alto, Calif.) -- At Harvard,
Carrie Grimes majored in archaeology and studied Mayan settlement
patterns. But she was drawn to what she called "all the computer
and math stuff" that was part of the job. She now works at Google,
using statistical analyses of mounds of data to come up with ways
to improve its search engine. Grimes is one of the Internet-age
statisticians who are changing the image of the profession as a
place for dronish number nerds. By Steve Lohr.

      EXP-GOLF-WATER-CONSERVE (Atlanta) -- Mindful that global warming
could provoke more and longer dry spells, state governments are
increasingly consulting golf courses on water strategies. In
Georgia, golf course managers have emerged as go-to gurus on water
conservation for both industries and nonprofit groups. By Leslie
Kaufman.

      EXP-BANKS-REGULATE (Washington) -- If President Barack Obama's
proposals to overhaul financial regulation fail in Congress, they
will largely be a casualty of the resistance to central elements of
the plan by his own regulators, who in turn reflect the views of
the banking industry segments they supervise. In what has become a
routine spectacle, the top regulators on Tuesday again challenged
major portions of the proposal at a congressional hearing. By
Stephen Labaton.

      EXP-IRAN (Beirut) -- With his adversaries shunning the ceremony
and security forces on the streets, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
was sworn into office for a second term on Wednesday, almost two
months after elections that divided the nation and sparked Iran's
deepest crisis since the Islamic revolution 30 years ago. By Robert
F. Worth.

      EXP-JAPAN-POLITICS (Matsuyama, Japan) -- The collapse of the
long-governing Liberal Democratic Party's base in the countryside
appears to be sending the party toward a humiliating loss in the
Aug. 30 national elections, which would knock them out of power for
only the second time since1955. By Martin Fackler.

      EXP-CAR-BATTERY-GRANTS (Washington) -- Seeking to put the nation
back in the lead on an important technology, the Obama
administration is awarding more than $2 billion in grants for
advanced battery manufacturing, mostly for electric cars. They are
meant to help companies scale up large-scale manufacturing lines
for modern batteries of the sort now mostly made in Asia. By
Matthew L. Wald.

      EXP-CHINA-U.S.-EXPATS (Beijing) -- Shanghai and Beijing are
becoming new lands of opportunity for recent American college
graduates who face unemployment at home. Even those with limited or
no knowledge of Chinese are heeding the call. They are lured by
China's surging economy, the lower cost of living, and a chance to
bypass some of the dues-paying common to first jobs in the United
States. By Hannah Seligson.

      EXP-PA-GYM-SHOOTING (Bridgeville, Pa.) -- The man who opened fire
in a busy fitness center, killing three women before committing
suicide, had planned the attack for months because of frustration
over his inability to find a girlfriend, according to a diary he
posted online. Two law enforcement officials confirmed reports that
the gunman was George Sodini, 48, of Scott Township, and they said
the diary appeared to be legitimate. By Sean D. Hamill.
