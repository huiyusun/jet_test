<DATELINE>
CONTRACTOR JAILED IN CUBA WAS AIDING RELIGIOUS GROUPS, U.S. SAYS Ginger Thompson reported from Washington, and Marc Lacey from Mexico City.      WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<P>
The American contractor detained in Cuba last month
and accused of being a spy is a 60-year-old social worker from the
Washington suburbs who had gone to Cuba to provide communications
equipment to Jewish nonprofit organizations, according to U.S.
officials.
</P>
<P>
In postings on the Internet, the contractor, Alan P. Gross --
whose identify had not previously been made public -- said he had
more than 20 years experience in development work around the world.
One of his Internet networking sites said he had been a volunteer
field organizer for Barack Obama's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say that Gross had gone to Cuba as part of a U.S.
government program and was providing encouragement and financial
assistance to religious nonprofit groups. The officials acknowledge
that Gross entered Cuba without the proper visa, though they
contend that he was not involved in any activities that posed a
violent threat to the Cuban government. And they flatly refute any
allegations that he is a spy.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government, however, has characterized his work as a
threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, where Cuba continues to fire political
passions, Gross' detention has become the source of new tensions
between Washington and Havana, and it threatens to ignite more
debate on Capitol Hill about how the Obama administration ought to
proceed in its Cuba policy.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the case has raised questions about whether the
administration should continue a Bush administration practice of
sending development workers to conduct semi-covert operations.
</P>
<P>
At the time Gross was detained, he had visited Cuba several
times, delivering computer and satellite equipment to three Jewish
community groups, according to people with knowledge of his work.
</P>
<P>
In December, they said, he was on a follow-up trip for
Development Alternatives Inc., a contractor working with the U.S.
Agency for International Development. The people who know about his
work, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not
authorized to comment on the matter, said Gross was sent to
research how the groups were making use of the equipment he had
previously distributed to them.
</P>
<P>
"His work in Cuba was focused on facilitating communications
among people in a nonviolent, nondissident religious
organization," DAI said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Details about Gross and his work in Cuba slowly began to emerge
this week. Gross studied social work at the University of Maryland
and the Virginia Commonwealth University, and he had a long career
as an international development worker that took him to at least 50
countries.
</P>
<P>
Friends described Gross as more a philanthropist than a
businessman. In 2001, he started a company called Joint Business
Development Center, whose Web site says it has "supported Internet
connectivity in locations where there was little or no access,"
including more than 60 satellite terminals in Iraq, Afghanistan,
Armenia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Records show his company earned less than $70,000 last year. One
friend, Howard Feinberg, who has known Gross from their work with
Jewish charitable organizations over 30 years, said, "The Alan I
know is someone who is concerned only about helping improve the
human condition, not meddling in people's politics."
</P>
<P>
Obama came to office promising a new era of engagement with
Cuba. But he has been reluctant to move forward, citing continuing
reports of human rights abuses in Cuba. Some Cuba experts have said
that Gross' arrest may harden Obama's stance.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, meanwhile, said the episode signaled that Obama was just
as committed to overthrowing the government as his predecessor was.
President Raul Castro railed about Gross' work in a speech last
month.
</P>
<P>
Havana has used Gross' arrest as an opportunity to raise an old
grievance: America's long prison terms for five Cuban agents
convicted of spying on Cuban exile organizations. Havana maintains
that the agents were in the United States to prevent terrorist acts
against Cuba and has called on the Obama administration to release
them.
</P>
<P>
As for Gross, Cuba has said very little. The government has not
formally charged him with a crime. Cuban authorities have provided
the United States almost no information on his case, nor have they
made any demands. It took three urgent diplomatic notes from the
United States before Cuban authorities would allow U.S. consular
officials to visit Gross.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Washington and many American experts on Cuba have
been left speculating about Havana's intentions.
</P>
<P>
"The Cuban regime is obviously looking for some kind of U.S.
concession, callously using the contractor as a bargaining chip,"
said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., a ranking member of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials said they suspected that Cuba aimed to shine
light on AID's undercover Cuba programs, whose financing has grown
in the past decade from some $5 million to over $45 million a year
and have a history of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
"We have spent a tremendous amount of money on these programs,
and what do we have to show for it?" asked Rep. Bill Delahunt,
D-Mass. "Are there other ways, or other methods to provide
information to nongovernmental groups? If we want to have influence
on the island, what makes sense?"
