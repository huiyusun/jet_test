HELOISE MAKEOVER: NOT YOU MOTHER ' S ' HINTS '
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN ANTONIO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than 20 years of wearing the same long
hairstyle, silver-tressed Ponce Kiah Marchelle Heloise Cruse Evans,
known simply as Heloise, has a new 'do for the New Year.
</P>
<P>
Just don't ask the San Antonio-based "Hints From Heloise"
columnist to color her gorgeous signature locks, which she's only
done once . . . but more on that later.
</P>
<P>
"I love it!" Heloise exclaims, shaking out her new look,
courtesy Jane Mulrenan, her personal hair stylist. "I've been
looking forward to this. It's just what I wanted."
</P>
<P>
What Heloise, the national high priestess of household hints,
wanted was a blunt-cut coif -- and sexy bangs. So eager was she to
get on with it that she fearlessly executed the first snip with her
mother's own oversized shears. In Mulrenan's hands, Heloise lost
eight inches in length all around.
</P>
<P>
And here's a hint: The bangs were trimmed vertically for a
fuller, yet airy, modern look.
</P>
<P>
Heloise's makeover -- hold onto your vinegar and baking soda,
including smoky eyes -- also is a wonderful example of using the New
Year as motivation for trying something new and fresh, perfect for
the first 2010 issue of Trends with a "New You" focus for the new
decade.
</P>
<P>
During a chat late last year, Heloise, the legendary syndicated
columnist featured internationally in hundreds of newspapers,
mentioned her hairstyle had been virtually unchanged for more than
two decades.
</P>
<P>
We offered to help her with an updated look. It was a special
occasion that called for Mulrenan and Heloise's on-call makeup
expert John McBurney, and a rack of clothes we pulled from local
stores -- looks she loved but said she never would have picked for
herself because the outfits were different from what she's
accustomed to wearing.
</P>
<P>
But isn't that part of the fun of getting a makeover? Getting
others who love fashion to suggest new ways to play up your own
sense of style -- and maybe step out of your comfort zone? After the
photo shoot, Heloise bought three of the four outfits.
</P>
<P>
Clothing, like one's hair style, is one's personal preference,
after all.
</P>
<P>
But often, all one needs is a little nudge to realize other
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, my hair style has always been a part of my comfort
zone,"
</P>
<P>
Heloise says, explaining why she hadn't changed her look all
these years. "A lot of women are afraid to make drastic hair
changes. Later you hear the horror stories about how they can't
maintain it."
</P>
<P>
Heloise recalls the one and only time she applied a temporary
rinse -- red, like Lucille Ball's. She played the joke on her
husband, David, who had been away on a trip (the two wondered how
she'd look).
</P>
<P>
When he arrived at home at 3 a.m., David was afraid he was in
the wrong house. "He nearly died!" Heloise recalls. "Every time
I turned a corner David would say, 'It just doesn't look like
you."'
</P>
<P>
She concurred, but it took two days to wash out the rinse,
except for "those orangey stripes on either side" that took
longer.
</P>
<P>
Now and again she will answer a hair or beauty question.
</P>
<P>
But what we really want to know is what question is asked most
often.
</P>
<P>
"That one," she deadpans, adding that coming in second are
inquires about stinks ("How can I get rid of that garbage disposal
smell?") and third, stains ("What do I do for ring around the
collar?")
</P>
<P>
For the smelly garbage disposal: "Fill the sink with
warm-to-hot water and a squirt of dish soap. Then pull out the
stopper and turn on the disposal. The water pressure causes a big
whoosh. This is a good preventative once a month and will also help
prevent a drain build-up that could lead to a big clog."
</P>
<P>
For the dingy ring around the collar: "Keep the biggest and
cheapest bottle of shampoo in the laundry room and pour it on the
line of dirt. Rub it in, let it set for a minute and toss it into
the laundry. Shampoo is a cleaning agent that breaks down dirt and
body oil in your hair and will do the same for that ring."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of shampoo gets us back to talking about hair and a
hair myth Heloise says we can bust.
</P>
<P>
"Cutting your hair at the ends does nothing to make it grow
faster," she says. "Your hair is dead once you cut it. It is
dead."
</P>
<P>
And don't get her going on another beauty tip: mascara. She
doesn't mind sleeping in hers -- and has been for more than 40
years.
</P>
<P>
"I know women behind the cosmetic counter say you have to take
it off every night. No you don't. It's waterproof. I do not wake up
looking like a raccoon and I don't sleep in contacts. I reapply in
the morning. I know I'll get mail on that one."
</P>
<P>
She receives as many as 3,000 e-mails, letters and faxes weekly
at Heloise central -- a ranch-style home and office on the city's
North Side built by her husband, a contractor.
</P>
<P>
In her leisure time, Heloise dotes on her antique rose bushes
she has tended for 15 years. They stretch more than 100 feet along
a fence. She enjoys flicks from the golden era of the silver screen
and often juggles two and three books simultaneously -- biographies,
history, the military and old Hollywood are favorite subjects. Not
long ago Marlene Dietrich, Gloria Swanson and Greta Garbo were on
her nightstand. Then came Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots.
</P>
<P>
She's also a bit of a daredevil, having ridden in a tank at Camp
Lejeune, flown in a T-38 at Randolph Air Force Base, pulled 7.8 Gs
with the Navy's Blue Angels and at 13,000 feet took a leap of faith
over San Antonio with the Army's Golden Knights parachute team.
</P>
<P>
"I am a military brat. I'm part of the family," Heloise says
proudly. Her father, Marshal Cruse, who went by Mike, "got his
wings here at Kelly Air Force Base. And my brother, Louis D. Cruse,
was in the Air Force at Lackland (Air Force Base)." Her dad, a
lieutenant colonel, also was a pilot during the Cold War era. He
died in 2006.
</P>
<P>
"I do what I can to help our service members and their families
because I've been there. I can help by visiting and giving hints or
by listening to get hints from them to share with others or answer
questions."
</P>
<P>
Why has the column endured?
</P>
<P>
"Because I've been offering years of expertise and knowledge on
what works and doesn't," she says, adding that she stays
technologically current with a Web site, podcasts and often
e-mailing photos and video she shoots on her cell phone. This month
she plans to kick off The Heloise Blog for the Express-News on
mySA.com as well as on the Houston Chronicle's Web site. The blog
also will go national, she said.
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the most meaningful explanation for the column's
longevity comes from the heart.
</P>
<P>
"Mother truly wrote from hers and so do I," Heloise says about
keeping it real and helping readers with "mundane, monotonous and
repetitious things in life we all have to do."
