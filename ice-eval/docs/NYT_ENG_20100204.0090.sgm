AMERICANS IN HAITI CHARGED WITH CHILDREN ' S ABDUCTION GINGER THOMPSON CONTRIBUTED REPORTING.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten Americans who tried to take 33
Haitian children out the country last week without the government's
consent have been charged with child abduction and criminal
conspiracy, as Haitian officials sought to reassert judicial
control after the Jan. 12 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The Americans, most of them members of a Baptist congregation
from Idaho, had said they intended to rescue Haitian children left
parentless in the quake and take them to what they described as an
orphanage across the border in the Dominican Republic. But they
acknowledged failing to seek approval to remove the children from
Haiti, and several of the children have at least one living parent.
</P>
<P>
The Americans will face a potentially extended legal proceeding
in Haiti and could, if convicted, face prison terms of up to 15
years.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Mazar Fortil, decided not to pursue what could
have been the most serious charge against the group, that of
trafficking. The charges will now be considered by an investigative
judge, who under Haitian law has up to three months to decide
whether to pursue the matter further.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the group, Laura Silsby, a businesswoman who
describes herself as a missionary as well, has also come under
scrutiny at home in Idaho, where employees complain of unpaid wages
and the state has placed liens on her company bank account.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer for the group, Edwin Coq, said after a hearing on
Thursday that nine of his 10 clients were "completely innocent,"
but that, in an apparent reference to Silsby, "If the judiciary
were to keep one, it could be the leader of the group."
</P>
<P>
The Haitian capital lost courthouses, judges, lawyers and its
main prison in the earthquake, straining the judiciary along with
everything else. Prosecutors said this was the first criminal case
to receive a hearing in Port-au-Prince since the natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
The hearing took place in a hilltop courthouse that had minor
cracks in the walls and scores of squatters living outside. A crush
of journalists sought access to the defendants on their way into
the courthouse, where police officers in riot gear prevented
access.
</P>
<P>
The Americans were transported in two Haitian police vehicles --
one labeled "Child Protection Brigade" -- from the police station
where they have been held since the weekend to Port-au-Prince's
main criminal courthouse. Coq said beforehand that their immediate
release was possible, and the police who transported the detainees
took their luggage to the hearing as well in case they were to be
freed.
</P>
<P>
Silsby, who had helped organize the group's mission, sounded a
hopeful note as she waited to be taken into court, saying, "We're
just trusting God for a positive outcome."
</P>
<P>
But during the hearing, Jean Ferge Joseph, a deputy prosecutor,
told the Americans that their case was not being dropped and that
it would be sent to a judge for further review. "That judge can
free you, but he can also continue to hold you for further
proceedings," the deputy prosecutor said, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
When they received the news, the Americans did not appear
distraught, Coq, their lawyer, said. "They prayed," he said.
"They looked down and prayed."
</P>
<P>
Reuters, which had a reporter in the session, reported that all
10 of the detainees acknowledged to the prosecutor that they had
apparently violated the law when they tried to take the children
from Haiti, although they said they were unaware of that until
after they were detained.
</P>
<P>
"We did not have any intention to violate the law but now we
understand it's a crime," said Paul Robert Thompson, a pastor who
led the group in prayer during a break in the session.
</P>
<P>
Silsby asked the prosecutor not only to release the group, whose
members range in age from 18 to 55, but to allow them to continue
their work in Haiti. "We simply wanted to help the children," she
said. "We petition the court not only for our freedom but also for
our ability to continue to help."
</P>
<P>
As they were led out of the courthouse one by one for their
return to jail, some of the Americans smiled as reporters
surrounded them. They left without comment.
</P>
<P>
The Americans were arrested on Friday as they tried to take the
33 children by bus to the Dominican Republic, where they said they
were in the process of leasing or building an orphanage. It is
unclear if the group had arranged for accommodations to house the
children in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
A Web site for the group, the New Life Children's Refuge, said
that the Haitian children there would stay in a "loving Christian
home-like environment" and be eligible for adoption through
agencies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Americans and members of their churches have said they are
innocent of any wrongdoing, and described the case as a
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
In an interview earlier this week, Silsby said the group had
come to Haiti to rescue children orphaned by the earthquake, and
that "our hearts were in the right place."
</P>
<P>
But some of the children had living parents, and some of those
parents said that the Baptists had promised simply to educate the
youngsters in the Dominican Republic and to allow them to return to
Haiti to visit.
</P>
<P>
Silsby had made her intentions known to child protection
officials, human rights experts and Dominican authorities in Haiti,
all of whom warned her that she could be charged with trafficking
if she tried to take children out of the country without proper
documentation.
</P>
<P>
Some Haitian leaders have called the Americans kidnappers, but
their case also has created divisions. Outside the courthouse on
Thursday, one onlookers backed the Americans. "The process they
followed was wrong, but they were not stealing kids," said
Beatrice St. Julien, a mother of one son. "They came here to help
us."
</P>
<P>
Until Thursday, Haitian judicial officials had left open the
possibility that the group could be returned to the United States
for trial, sparing Haiti's crippled justice system a high-profile
criminal prosecution fraught with diplomatic and political land
mines.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have been in communication with their Haitian
counterparts to discuss the case, but the State Department has also
said that the decision on whether to pursue charges committed on
Haitian soil remains a Haitian matter.
</P>
<P>
One expert said that by pursuing the case Haitian authorities
seemed to be trying to make a point. "Haiti's decision to
prosecute the Baptist missionaries may be motivated, in part, by
the need to show its own people and the world that it is a viable
entity that is tackling the grave problem of international child
abductions in Haiti," Christopher J. Schmidt, a lawyer with Bryan
Cave LLP in St. Louis who has been involved in multiple cases of
international kidnapping, said in a statement.
