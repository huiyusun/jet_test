The leader of the group of Americans charged
on Thursday with abducting children in Haiti is an Idaho
businesswoman with a complicated financial history that involves
complaints from employees over unpaid wages, state liens on a
company bank account and lawsuits in small claims court.
</P>
<P>
The leader, Laura Silsby, defaulted in July on the mortgage on a
house in an unfinished subdivision here in Meridian, a suburb of
Boise, according to the Ada County Tax Assessor's Office. Yet in
November, Silsby registered a new nonprofit, the New Life
Children's Refuge, at the address of the house, which she bought in
2008 for $358,000.
</P>
<P>
New Life Children's Refuge is the name of the orphanage Silsby
and the nine other Americans charged in Haiti said they had planned
to establish in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
Silsby lost the house in Meridian to foreclosure on Dec. 7,
records show, and it stands empty, with signs in the yard promoting
a foreclosure sale.
</P>
<P>
"I get mail for her all the time," said LaChelle Bohner, who
lives two doors down from the house. Bohner said the mail included
collection notices.
</P>
<P>
Silsby and her business, Personal Shopper, which provides
shopping services for Internet customers, have faced multiple legal
claims.
</P>
<P>
According to state records and officials, Personal Shopper has
been named 14 times in complaints from employees over unpaid wages.
Among the reasons cited by the employees for having not been paid
were "no money for payroll" and "fully investor funded and
investors have been hit hard by the economy."
</P>
<P>
Employees won nine of the cases, forcing Personal Shopper to pay
nearly $31,000 in wages and $4,000 in fines. The Idaho Department
of Labor initially put liens on a company bank account to get the
money.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't like that so they said: 'How much do we owe? We'll
pay it,"' said Bob Fick, a spokesman for the department, adding
that unpaid wage complaints were not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
State officials said Personal Shopper had paid all the wage
claims upheld by the state. But another former employee has sued
Personal Shopper in civil court. A jury trial is set for Feb. 22
over a claim by the employee, Robin Oliver, that Personal Shopper
owes her more than $22,000.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Silsby said Thursday that he could not comment on
the case.
</P>
<P>
One of the people awarded unpaid wages was Chris Holmes, who
said he was not surprised that Silsby had run into trouble in
Haiti. Holmes, who did database work, said Silsby often showed a
"lack of forethought," shifting business models to suit the
investors who kept the company afloat.
</P>
<P>
"She would come up with an idea on Wednesday, and on Friday
there would be a new idea that was 180 degrees different," Holmes
said.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, Silsby received a Femtor Award for "Businesswoman of
the Year"; the awards are sponsored by the eWomenNetwork, a group
that promotes women and their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Silsby, who has young children in Idaho, was divorced in 2007.
She and her former husband lived in Meridian, but public records
were not clear about where she currently resides.
</P>
<P>
The offices of Personal Shopper, in an office park in Meridian,
have been shuttered this week, with mail dating to at least last
week stacked on the floor.
</P>
<P>
Clint Henry, pastor of Central Valley Baptist Church in
Meridian, where five of the Americans charged in Haiti attend
services, said Silsby had attended his church for about two years.
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't find any finer Christian people than these
people," Henry said in an interview earlier this week.
