AFTER KILLING A CHIMP, THE DESCENT OF AN OFFICER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
STAMFORD, Conn.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everybody here knew Travis the Chimp, whose
owners drove him around in a tow truck, and Police Officer Frank
Chiafari, on the job for 25 years, remembered playing with him when
their paths would cross.
</P>
<P>
"When I saw him, he was small and cute and friendly -- he'd wave
at you," Chiafari recalled. "Who would have ever thought when we
were playing together, we'd have this incident 15 years later?"
</P>
<P>
It has been a little over a year since Travis, the 14-year-old,
200-pound pet of Sandra Herold, 71, mauled a family friend in
Herold's driveway. Chiafari and another officer were the first to
respond to Herold's 911 call, and after the chimpanzee attacked his
vehicle and opened the driver-side door in the driveway, Chiafari
fatally shot Travis.
</P>
<P>
The story and its sensational underpinnings -- Travis lived like
a human, eating steak and drinking wine and, when he became hostile
the day of the attack, ingesting Xanax -- swept the globe. Travis
had appeared in Old Navy and Coca-Cola commercials and television
shows; the actress Morgan Fairchild, who had appeared beside him,
called his death a "sin."
</P>
<P>
The victim, Charla Nash, 56, survived. Her recovery from the
attack -- the chimp bit and clawed off her face and hands -- was
presented to the world via an episode of the "Oprah Winfrey Show"
in November. She was blind, her features lost in a bulbous and
livid pulp.
</P>
<P>
But until now, no one had heard Chiafari's story.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in Stamford police headquarters on Tuesday,
Chiafari, 53, a husband and a father of three, described that day
and the crippling depression and anxiety that followed. He was
haunted not just by the frightening encounter with the bloody and
enraged chimp that outweighed him by 50 pounds, but also by images
of the victim in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
"I'd go to the mall and see women and imagine them without
faces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiafari required therapy but was denied a worker's compensation
claim. The reason was harrowing episodes involving a person --
shooting a suspect, for example -- would be covered but similar
encounters with animals were not.
</P>
<P>
His visits to a therapist were eventually covered by the city of
Stamford after police and union officials became involved on his
behalf, said Sgt. Joseph Kennedy, president of the Stamford Police
Association.
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Andrew J. McDonald, a Stamford Democrat, has
introduced legislation that would cover an officer's compensation
for mental or emotional impairment after killing an animal when
under threat of deadly force. Chiafari plans to testify on Thursday
at a General Assembly Committee on Labor and Public Employees
hearing on behalf of the proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
Chiafari did not come to the job naturally. Raised in Queens, he
moved to Connecticut in his late 20s after eight years working in
Manhattan as an apprentice at a printer and as a store detective in
Times Square -- a job he said he hated. A singer-songwriter, he
performed Beatles covers and original songs in clubs in Queens and
Long Island and at parties.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he took the Stamford police test with a friend and
passed; he joined the department in 1985. He still sings and
continues to record covers and original songs. He regularly takes
long walks to relax, and he loves animals. He had only once before
fired his gun in the line of duty, to kill a deer that had been
struck by a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 16, 2009, Chiafari started his shift at 3 p.m.,
reporting his location with his police radio and stopping at a
Starbucks for tea with another officer. Then the radio sounded.
</P>
<P>
"The call came over as 'monkey attacking someone,' " he said.
"At first it sounded humorous. Then they said, 'Code Three' --
lights and sirens, get there fast.
</P>
<P>
"I could tell something was not right."
</P>
<P>
The dispatcher became more urgent as the officers, in separate
cars, sped to Herold's house on Rock Rimmon Road. Chiafari realized
who the so-called monkey was: The Herold family owned a towing
company that occasionally responded to police calls to move
vehicles, and they would bring their pet chimp along. ("Travis
loves cops," Herold said in 1998.)
</P>
<P>
As Chiafari drove, he thought, "Wait a minute, that's Travis."
</P>
<P>
He pulled up to the house and saw a lump of clothing in the
driveway. "Then I realized it's a human being," he said. "It was
all ripped apart."
</P>
<P>
He parked to the right of the body, and the other officer parked
on its left. Chiafari's car blocked the body from the front porch,
where he saw Travis jumping up and down, in a "frenzy."
</P>
<P>
"He starts bashing the passenger window," he said. "I'm
terrified. I see what he's done to the victim." He drew his
pistol, but Herold, who had been hiding in a vehicle, emerged
behind the chimp, entering his line of fire. He looked back at the
victim. "She had no face, and there's blood pulsating out. She's
bleeding out." He holstered his gun.
</P>
<P>
Travis swatted the side-view mirror off the squad car "like it
was butter," Chiafari said. As he puzzled over how he could help
the victim, Travis returned to the porch, then calmly walked around
his car and approached the driver-side door.
</P>
<P>
"I forgot I had the door unlocked," Chiafari said. He had
unlocked it to help Nash before the chimp distracted him. "He
pulls the door open. Now we're, like, face to face with each other.
Our eyes met."
</P>
<P>
There was blood all over the chimp, whose owner had stabbed him
in the back with a butcher knife. The chimp seemed as surprised
that he had opened the door as Chiafari, who was pinned in his seat
by a computer console and again drawing his pistol.
</P>
<P>
"He gave me a split second to react," he said. "He shows his
teeth, a snarl, and I see blood. I see his fangs. I just start to
shoot."
</P>
<P>
He said that he does not remember hearing the four shots and
that the chimp did not seem to react; he thought the gun had
misfired. But then Travis screamed one last time and ambled away.
</P>
<P>
Chiafari and paramedics, who had been waiting in their vehicles
for the chimp to leave, rushed to the body on the ground. "She had
no face," he said. "Her hands are off. There are thumbs and
fingers all over the place." He called out to her. "I feel bad,
but I was hoping she wasn't conscious."
</P>
<P>
But Nash reached out with the stumps of her arms and tried to
grab the officer's leg, a memory that was perhaps the worst for him
that day.
</P>
<P>
Travis had entered his home and died in his living quarters.
Nash was rushed to a hospital. Chiafari was, too, for shock, and
then sent home, where he told his wife and children -- a 10-year-old
girl and a teenage boy and girl -- what had happened.
</P>
<P>
"The next morning, I crashed," he said. "I'd always heard of
post-traumatic stress. Tell you the truth, I don't think I believed
in it."
</P>
<P>
He saw a therapist and told the story with great difficulty,
remembering the chimp's fingers -- "like sausages" -- smashing at
his window and rocking the car. After the attack, he said, he could
not wear a red shirt because it reminded him of blood. Everyone
wanted to hear the story. His therapist told him to politely
decline, which helped.
</P>
<P>
Chiafari returned to work a month or so later. At first he could
not drive down Rock Rimmon Road, until he forced himself to visit
the fateful driveway and confront his fear.
</P>
<P>
People second-guessed him: "Why didn't I wait for a stun gun?
Why didn't I talk to it?" He shook his head. "I can't say, 'Hey
Travis, let's wait for a stun gun.' " He believes shooting the
chimp when he did saved Nash's life by allowing paramedics to reach
her.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, waves of panic and depression came and went. He was
plagued by dreams of a faceless woman on a July family visit to
Disney World that ruined his appetite and his vacation. Nash's
much-publicized "Oprah" visit, which he avoided watching, brought
back painful memories. But he said he was feeling more and more
like his old self.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a positive person," he said, adding that he holds open
the possibility of meeting Nash someday -- but not yet.
</P>
<P>
He has a sense of humor about his reaction to that day. "I'll
go to the store and my daughter will say, 'Daddy, don't look in the
corner,' and it's a chimp in the corner," he said with a laugh. He
still avoids news coverage of the shooting and any shows about
deadly chimps. "On TV, 'When Animals Attack' -- I turn it off."
</P>
<P>
So naturally, when the Animal Planet network asked if Chiafari
would participate in a re-enactment of the attack, he declined.
Someone else played his part, and the episode is scheduled to be
shown on March 28 as part of a series titled "Fatal Attractions."
</P>
<P>
Travis dictated the events of that fatal day, but Chiafari does
not hold him responsible.
</P>
<P>
"I consider him a victim," he said. "He should have been in
the jungle where he's supposed to be. Not in a house drinking wine
and taking Xanax."
