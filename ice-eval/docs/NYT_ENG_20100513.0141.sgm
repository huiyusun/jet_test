A Dutch boy who was the only survivor of a plane crash
in Libya that killed 103 people was in stable condition Thursday
after undergoing surgery on his broken legs, according to Libyan
hospital officials quoted by news agencies.
</P>
<P>
Ruben van Assouw, 9, from the city of Tilburg, was returning
from a South African safari with his 11-year-old brother and their
parents, his grandmother told a Dutch newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The grandmother, An van de Sande, spoke to Brabants Dagblad, and
a photograph on the paper's website showed the boy in a hospital
bed in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. She said Ruben would be taken
back to the Netherlands as soon as he was able to travel.
</P>
<P>
The airliner crashed Wednesday morning on approach to the
airport in Tripoli. Libyan and Dutch officials said 92 passengers
were killed -- most of them Dutch tourists -- along with 11 crew
members.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hameeda al-Saheli, the head of the pediatric unit at the
hospital, told the state news agency in Libya that Ruben had four
breaks in his legs, The Associated Press reported, although he had
no neurological injuries or internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
The plane, Afriqiyah Airways Flight 771 from Johannesburg,
crashed at 6 a.m., the airline said.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash of the Airbus jet, which occurred in good
weather, was under investigation, though Libya's transportation
minister said Libyan authorities had ruled out terrorism. That
determination was made quickly, and the minister, Mohammed Zidan,
gave no indication of how officials had reached that conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The flight recorders have been retrieved from the wreckage and
will be analyzed, Zidan said.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Hoeltgen, a spokesman for the European Aviation Safety
Agency in Cologne, Germany, said the aircraft had been inspected at
least three times in recent months by the French civil aviation
authority, which did not find any significant safety problems.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Royal Dutch Touring Club ANWB said 61 of the
dead were with two Dutch tour groups returning from South Africa,
one going to Brussels and the other to Dusseldorf, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Ad Meijer, a spokesman in The Hague for the Dutch foreign
minister, Maxime Verhagen, said the Dutch Embassy staff had not yet
verified whether all of those tourists were Dutch.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Office confirmed that
at least one British citizen was on board.According to news
reports, 22 victims were Libyan and at least 3 were South African.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Investigations and Analyses in France said that it
had sent two investigators to Tripoli and that Airbus, which
manufactured the plane, had sent a team of five specialists to
assist the Libyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Photos from the scene showed debris strewn across a wide area.
Workers wearing surgical masks picked through gnarled rows of
seats, retrieving remains and personal items like passports and
cell phones. With the exception of the plane's tail fin and parts
of the wings, few large pieces of the plane appeared to have
remained intact.
</P>
<P>
Airbus said the plane was delivered in September to Afriqiyah
Airways. The plane had accumulated about 1,600 flight hours in
about 420 flights.
</P>
<P>
Flight 771 originated in Johannesburg and was scheduled to stop
in Tripoli before continuing to Gatwick Airport near London. The
airline's schedule indicated that the plane was an Airbus A330-200
with a capacity of 253 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Afriqiyah Airways said the plane crashed just short of the
runway. The skies were clear with visibility of 3 to 4 miles, and
the winds were very light, according to weather reports. The crash
was the first for Afriqiyah, which was founded in Tripoli in 2001.
