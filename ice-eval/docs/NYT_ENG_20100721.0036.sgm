Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Wednesday he
is reconsidering his department's decision to fire a Georgia
official in wake of new details about her controversial speech to
the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
Vilsack said in a statement early Wednesday morning that he will
"conduct a thorough review and consider additional facts" about
his decision to ask Shirley Sherrod to resign. Washington's
apparent reversal came hours after a video of Sherrod's full speech
was released, and the director of rural development in Georgia was
defended by the white couple at the center of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
The full, uncut video of a federal agricultural official's NAACP
speech purporting racial scheming, told a different story than the
barely three-minute snippet that cost Sherrod her job.
</P>
<P>
Despite admitting in the edited version of the taping that she
once withheld help to the couple on the basis of race, Sherrod was
defended Tuesday by the wife of a white Georgia farmer.
</P>
<P>
Sherrod "kept us out of bankruptcy," said Eloise Spooner, 82,
of Iron City in southwest Georgia. Spooner, in an interview with
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, added she considers Sherrod a
"friend for life." She and her husband, Roger Spooner, approached
Sherrod for help in 1986 when Sherrod worked for a nonprofit that
assisted farmers.
</P>
<P>
Sherrod, who is African-American, was asked to resign Monday
night by a USDA official after videotaped comments she made in
March at a local NAACP banquet surfaced on the Web. Recounting her
dealings with the Spooners, Sherrod said she didn't help them as
much as she could because of their race.
</P>
<P>
But a review of the entire 43-minute, 15-second speech --
released Tuesday on the NAACP website -- showed that Sherrod was
giving a cautionary tale about the evils of racial separation.
</P>
<P>
"When I made that commitment (at age 17 years old to remain in
Georgia and help people), I was making that commitment to black
people, and to black people only," Sherrod said nearly 15 minutes
into the recording, just seconds before the segment that brought
her trouble. "But you know, God will ... put things in your path
so that you realize that the struggle was really about poor
people."
</P>
<P>
Next, Sherrod would say the words that eventually led to her
losing her job.
</P>
<P>
"(The white farmer) was trying to show me he was superior to
me," she said, recalling the day some 24 years ago. "I knew what
he was doing, but he had to come to me for help."
</P>
<P>
Eloise Spooner said as far as she's concerned Sherrod worked
tirelessly to help the couple hold onto their land as they faced
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Vilsack issued a statement Tuesday saying the controversy made
Sherrod's position as a rural development director, a job she was
appointed to last March, untenable. But Vilsack said Wednesday that
after learning more about what Sherrod actually said, he would
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
Vilsack said in a statement early Wednesday that he will
"conduct a thorough review and consider additional facts" about
his decision to ask Sherrod to resign.
</P>
<P>
The NAACP, which had released a statement Monday critical of
Sherrod, backtracked Tuesday, saying it was "snookered" by Andrew
Breitbart, whose website biggovernment.com released the edited
video. Breitbart did not respond to a request seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
"Having reviewed the full tape, spoken to Ms. Sherrod, and most
importantly heard the testimony of the white farmers mentioned in
this story, we now believe the organization that edited the
documents did so with the intention of deceiving millions of
Americans," NAACP President Ben Jealous said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The tape of Ms. Sherrod's speech at an NAACP banquet was
deliberately edited to create a false impression of racial bias,
and to create a controversy where none existed. This just shows the
lengths to which extremist elements will go to discredit legitimate
opposition," Jealous said
</P>
<P>
In the video, Sherrod told the crowd at the NAACP banquet in
Douglas, Ga., that she didn't do everything she could to help a
white farmer whom she said was condescending when he came to her
for aid.
</P>
<P>
"What he didn't know while he was taking all that time trying
to show me he was superior to me was, I was trying to decide just
how much help I was going to give him," Sherrod said on the video.
"I was struggling with the fact that so many black people had lost
their farmland, and here I was faced with having to help a white
person save their land. So I didn't give him the full force of what
I could do. I did enough."
</P>
<P>
Sherrod, in her first interview after the clip surfaced, told
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution the video was selectively edited.
</P>
<P>
While she soon admitted as she told her story that she referred
the Spooners to a white lawyer so "his own kind would help him,"
she followed that admission with a revelation that was omitted from
the two-minute, 36-second excerpt of the speech posted by
Breitbart's group.
</P>
<P>
Sherrod told the crowd that she discovered the white lawyer took
their money for six months, but did nothing to help them.
</P>
<P>
"This lawyer told them, 'ya'll are getting old ... why don't
you just let go of the farm,"' she said. "I could not believe he
said that to them."
</P>
<P>
Sherrod said she'd learned her lesson.
</P>
<P>
"It's about the poor," Sherrod said, just over 20 minutes into
the speech. "It made me see it really was about those who have,
versus those who don't ... black, white or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
"It made me realize that I needed to work to help poor people
... those who don't have access the way others have."
</P>
<P>
She said the incident helped her get beyond issues of race.
</P>
<P>
"And I went on to work with many more white farmers," she
said. "The story helped me realize that race is not the issue,
it's about the people who have and the people who don't."
</P>
<P>
Sherrod accused the USDA of cowering to right-wing media.
</P>
<P>
"They were just looking at what the Tea Party and what Fox
(News) said, and thought it was too (politically) dangerous for
them," Sherrod said.
