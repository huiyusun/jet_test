U.S. SAID TO PLAN EASING OF RULES FOR TRAVEL TO CUBA

The Obama administration is planning to expand
opportunities for Americans to travel to Cuba, the latest step
aimed at encouraging more contact between people in both countries,
while leaving intact the decades-old embargo against the island's
Communist government, according to congressional and administration
officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials, who asked not to be identified because they had
not been authorized to discuss the policy before it was announced,
said it was meant to loosen restrictions on academic, religious and
cultural groups that were adopted under President George W. Bush,
and return to the "people to people" policies followed under
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Those policies, officials said, fostered robust exchanges
between the United States and Cuba, allowing groups -- including
universities, sports teams, museums and chambers of commerce -- to
share expertise as well as life experiences.
</P>
<P>
Policy analysts said the intended changes would mark a
significant shift in Cuba policy. In early 2009, President Barack
Obama lifted restrictions on travel and remittances only for
Americans with relatives on the island.
</P>
<P>
Congressional aides cautioned that some administration officials
still saw the proposals as too politically volatile to announce
until after the coming midterm elections, and they said revisions
could still be made.
</P>
<P>
But others said the policy, which does not need legislative
approval, would be announced before Congress returned from its
break in mid-September, partly to avoid a political backlash from
outspoken groups within the Cuban American lobby -- backed by Sen.
Robert Menendez, D-N.J. -- that oppose any softening in Washington's
position toward Havana.
</P>
<P>
Those favoring the change said that with a growing number of
polls showing that Cuban-Americans' attitudes toward Cuba had
softened as well, the administration did not expect much of a
backlash.
</P>
<P>
"They have made the calculation that if you put a smarter Cuba
policy on the table, it will not harm us in the election cycle,"
said one Democratic congressional aide who has been working with
the administration on the policy. "That, I think, is what animates
this."
</P>
<P>
Menendez, in a statement, objected to the anticipated changes.
"This is not the time to ease pressure on the Castro regime," he
said, referring to President Raul Castro of Cuba, who took office
in 2006 after his brother, Fidel, fell ill. Menendez added that
promoting travel would give Havana a "much need infusion of
dollars that will only allow the Castro brothers to extend their
reign of oppression."
</P>
<P>
In effect, the new policy would expand current channels for
travel to Cuba, rather than create new ones. Academic, religious
and cultural groups are now allowed to travel under very tight
rules. For example, students wanting to study in Cuba are required
to stay at least 10 weeks. And only accredited universities can
apply for academic visas.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, such restrictions would be eased,
officials said. And academic institutions, including research and
advocacy groups and museums, would be able to seek licenses for as
long as two years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the administration is also planning to allow
flights to Cuba from more cities than the three -- Miami, New York,
and Los Angeles -- currently permitted. And there are proposals, the
officials said, to allow all Americans to send remittances or
charitable donations to churches, schools and human rights groups
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the measures were partly a response to
pressure from an unlikely alliance of liberal political groups and
conservative business associations -- led by Sen. John Kerry, head
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- who have been pushing
Congress to lift all restrictions on travel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Others described it as a nod to Castro's stunning decision last
month to begin releasing dozens of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"It's a way of fostering greater opening and exchange without a
bruising battle with a much-needed political ally in an election
year," said Christopher Sabatini, senior policy director at the
Council of the Americas. "But it can still be legitimately couched
as a way of supporting democracy and human rights by allowing
independent exchange and thought."
</P>
<P>
As with everything concerning Cuba, the new policy seems fraught
with complications. Obama, who came to office promising to open new
channels of engagement with Cuba, has so far had limited those new
openings to Cuban-Americans, partly because of political concerns,
and also because his administration's attention had been focused on
more pressing foreign policy matters, including two wars.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the administration believes this will produce
palpable change in the short term," said Julia Sweig of the
Council on Foreign Relations. "But it's a way over the long term
to allow Americans and Cubans to have contact, even as their
governments continue to hash out a lot of seriously thorny
issues."
</P>
<P>
High on America's list of issues is winning the release of an
American contractor who was detained in Cuba nine months ago when
authorities said they caught him distributing satellite telephones
to Jewish dissident groups.
</P>
<P>
The contractor, Alan P. Gross, had gone to Cuba without the
proper visa as part of longstanding program by the organization
USAID, in which development workers conduct activities aimed at
strengthening groups that oppose the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with a relationship that's so contorted, it
would take another 50 years of incremental steps to pull it apart
and reassemble it in a constructive way," said Robert Pastor, a
professor of international relations at American University. "Even
then, we're having trouble taking baby steps, when what we need is
a giant leap."
