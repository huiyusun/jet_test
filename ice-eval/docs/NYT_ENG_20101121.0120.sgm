NORRIS CHURCH MAILER, ARTIST AND WRITER, DIES AT 61
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norris Church Mailer, a woman bred in the rural poverty of
Arkansas who married Norman Mailer and managed his career and
family life over three decades while carving out her own niche as a
writer, died Sunday at her home in New York. She was 61.
</P>
<P>
The cause was the gastrointestinal cancer that she had battled
for 11 years, said her son John Buffalo Mailer.
</P>
<P>
Mailer, who had grown up as Barbara Jean Davis, was a high
school art teacher, former pickle-factory worker and divorced
mother when Norman Mailer came to Russellville, Ark., in 1975 to
plug his book-length reflection on Marilyn Monroe. New York-bred,
Harvard-educated, with the first of two Pulitzer Prizes to his
credit, he was almost as celebrated for his brawling egocentrism
and intellectual provocations as he was for his novels. He was also
twice her age and by that point had been married four times.
</P>
<P>
But as a Book-of-the-Month Club member, she was eager that he
sign her copy of "Marilyn." After a few moments of conversation,
he was enchanted. She found him "easily the most interesting man I
had ever met." She was to give another motive for their magnetic
attraction.
</P>
<P>
"Sex was the cord that bound us together," she wrote.
</P>
<P>
Within months, she moved to New York where, as she wrote in "A
Ticket to the Circus," the memoir she published this year, Norman
Mailer became "the Henry Higgins to my Eliza Doolittle." She
worked for Wilhelmina Models and changed her name. Norris echoed
her first husband's surname, but it was Norman Mailer, who died in
2007 at 84, who dreamed up Church because he was struck by her
having attended Free Will Baptist services three times a week as a
child.
</P>
<P>
She gave birth to John Buffalo in 1978 and spent much of her
time taking care of him; her first child, Matthew; and several of
Norman Mailer's seven other children. Norman Mailer, whom she
married in 1980, was by all accounts an attentive father, and at
one point seven people were squeezed into the Mailers' apartment.
All nine children were rounded up for summers in Maine and later
Provincetown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
She was able to enter her husband's potentially daunting orbit
of the famous and the accomplished -- people like Woody Allen, Bob
Dylan and Jackie Onassis. She also organized her husband's social
and family life and defended him against antagonists, like
feminists offended by his 1971 volume, "The Prisoner of Sex."
</P>
<P>
"To me, the humor and irony was inherent," she later wrote.
"But you can't transfer the twinkle in the eye to the page, so a
lot of people treated everything he said as perfectly serious, like
his famous comment that women should be kept in cages. Who would
think he was serious about that?"
</P>
<P>
At one point the two nearly split over Norman Mailer's
infidelities (one mistress, Carole Mallory, recently wrote a memoir
of her eight-year affair), but he pleaded with her to stay, and she
did, wanting to hold the family together. She also confided in a
recent interview that she could not think of a single person she
would rather have been with.
</P>
<P>
She worked hard at making her own cultural mark. She had nine
one-woman art shows and, according to John Buffalo, appeared in
several plays. Early in their relationship she showed her husband
100 pages of a novel; his response, she recalled, was, "It's not
as bad as I thought it would be." She put it away, but it came out
in 2000 as "Windchill Summer," a story about coming of age in
Arkansas during the Vietnam War. In 2007 she published a sequel,
"Cheap Diamonds," about an aspiring model from Arkansas who
arrives in New York in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Whatever her own achievements, friends said she seldom lost her
open-hearted, down-to-earth sensibility.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not an intellectual," she said in an interview this year
with The New York Times. "I pick up People magazine instead of
TheNew York Review of Books and read it first. That's just a fact.
I tried very hard to make myself more literate, and I'm not a
stupid woman, but some things interest me and some things don't."
</P>
<P>
Although her parents were from Arkansas, she was born on Jan.
31, 1949, in the state of Washington, where her father, James
Davis, took a job building a dam while putting his family up in a
trailer. By the time she was 2 they had returned to Arkansas, and
she grew up in Atkins in a home that had an outhouse.
</P>
<P>
At the age of 3 she won the title of Little Miss Little Rock. At
20 she married her high school sweetheart, Larry Norris, but they
divorced after five years. In addition to John Buffalo and Matthew,
survivors include her stepchildren, Susan, Danielle, Elizabeth,
Kate, Michael, Stephen and Maggie Mailer; and her mother, Gaynell
Davis.
</P>
<P>
Before she met Mailer, she claimed, she had a fling with the
then-unmarried Bill Clinton. In her memoir she told the story with
characteristic wit. A friend who was in politics told her when
Clinton was president, "I guess he slept with every woman in
Arkansas except you."
</P>
<P>
"Sorry," she replied. "I'm afraid he got us all."
