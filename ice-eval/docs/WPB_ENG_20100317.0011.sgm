<P>
The liberal-leaning Center for Democracy in the Americas, which regularly takes
small groups of key Hill staffers to Cuba, has a four-day trip scheduled for
March 28 to find some facts. This year, about 10 aides, mostly from the House
side, had signed up, even though there is no beach time on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
But Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez, N.J., and Bill Nelson, Fla., in a "Dear
Colleague" letter last week, urged their fellow senators not to allow their
aides to go. Last year, former senator Mel Martinez, R-Fla., met with the aides
who'd signed up to dissuade them from going. They went anyway.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make you aware of a number of serious issues in our bilateral
relationship that may affect your decision to have your staff participate in
this delegation to Cuba," Menendez and Nelson wrote in their March 9 letter.
</P>
<P>
They cited the case of Agency for International Development subcontractor Alan
Gross, who was working in Cuba on a tourist visa and possessed satellite
communications equipment, who has been held in a maximum security prison since
his arrest Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
They also noted the recent death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, "a 42-year-0ld Cuban
dissident (who) died after going on a prolonged hunger strike in protest of his
ongoing beatings at the hands of the regime's prison officials." About 200
political prisoners are brutally treated in Cuban prisons, they said.
</P>
<P>
So "to have visits to Cuba in light of these deaths and human rights abuses
sends the wrong signal to the Castro regime," they wrote. If some on "your staff
do travel to Cuba," they wrote, "we would urge them to make as a precondition
... the unfettered access to non-governmental civil society groups and activists
in order to gain an understanding of the full spectrum of life in Cuba."
</P>
<P>
We're told this trip, like previous ones, includes meetings with Catholic Church
folks, civil society people, musicians and artists, as well as government
officials. There's usually an overnight jaunt to a rural area to see how
different things are out in the campo.
</P>
<P>
Numerous organizations have sponsored bipartisan lawmaker and staff trips to
Cuba over the years. (If you're not on this one, the New America Foundation has
one going in a few weeks that will be led by former lawmakers.) U.S. citizens,
with some exceptions, generally are barred from travel to Cuba _ as opposed to
traveling to other repressive states such as North Korea, Iran, Libya, Burma,
Sudan, Laos, Saudi Arabia, China or any other country on the planet. There's
even a tourism company offering Americans trips to scenic North Korea. Go to
www.northkorea1on1.com.
</P>
<P>
Nelson went to Syria in 2006, brushing aside similar Bush White House objections
over things such as Syrian political prisoners and its alleged the assassination
of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005. He also stopped in to see the
Saudis, and he has visited with the Chicom leadership. Menendez has visited
Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, deemed "not free" on the Freedom House listings.
Unclear whether either has asked his Cuban-American constituents _ who enjoy
unlimited travel and are going regularly to visit relatives on the island _ to
forgo visiting for the moment.
