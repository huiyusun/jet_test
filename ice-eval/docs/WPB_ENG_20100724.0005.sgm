Paul Rosen, an electrical engineer who in the mid-1950s helped develop the high-
speed modem, spurring revolutionary progress in the nascent industry of
telecommunications, died of congestive heart failure July 20 at his cottage in
West Bath, Maine. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
The technology behind the modem _ a device that converts data into signals that
can be passed through channels such as phone lines _ has existed in primitive
forms since the late 1940s. But in those days, phone lines carried data signals
inconsistently, and information was transmitted slowly.
</P>
<P>
While working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory
in 1958, Rosen and a colleague, Jack Harrington, patented a device that rapidly
transmitted large amounts of data over phone lines.
</P>
<P>
Their invention, "Method of Land Line Pulse Transmission," helped expand
computer networks nationwide by significantly accelerating the flow of data over
phone lines.
</P>
<P>
"One of my colleagues said, `Oh, you're going to get rich on this,' " Rosen said
in a 2004 interview with IEEE, the organization formerly known as the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
</P>
<P>
But the patent's wording was too constrained _ the work of an inept lawyer,
Rosen often said _ which allowed competitors such as AT&amp;T's Bell Labs to create
their own modems by making only minor adjustments to the patented design. Thus,
Rosen never made the fortune he thought he deserved when high-speed modems based
on his work began popping up across the United States.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Rosen's system was a crucial addition to a landmark Army defense
project during the Cold War. The SAGE program, or Semi-Automatic Ground
Environment, was a series of more than 100 radar installations spread across the
northern border of the United States. Each station sent data about incoming
planes, such as Russian bombers loaded with nuclear weapons, to centers around
the country at a rate of more than 1,800 bits per second through Mr. Rosen's
modems.
</P>
<P>
The standard maximum speed for data transmission was about 600 bps, but Rosen's
breakthrough technology allowed the military to monitor U.S. air space nearly in
real time.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, for his leadership and contributions in military communications, Rosen
was made a fellow of the IEEE, one of the most prestigious honors for engineers.
</P>
<P>
Paul Rosen was born in Boston on Jan. 4, 1922. His parents were Jewish
immigrants from Russia, and he grew up in ghettos in suburban Boston. His
father's first job in the United States was washing milk cans at a dairy.
</P>
<P>
Rosen said he became fascinated with engineering while toying with old crystal
radios as a teen-ager. At what is now Tufts University, Rosen said, he received
a "lousy education" and made money working in the school's machine shop, where
he made cast-iron ingots for 40 cents an hour. He graduated with a bachelor's
degree in electrical engineering in 1944 and joined the Navy during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
After sporadic training that included stints as an enlisted sailor and deck
officer, Rosen spent the rest of his Navy service in Guam with a logistics
company, supervising the loading and unloading ships.
</P>
<P>
The two supplies that Mr. Rosen said his company never ran out of were shaved
ice and beer.
</P>
<P>
Rosen began working at MIT in the late 1940s, where he later received a master's
degree in engineering. At the Lincoln Laboratory, he became a senior leader in
the communications and mechanical engineering divisions and oversaw the
development of radar systems, satellites and data encryption systems.
</P>
<P>
For much of his time at MIT, Rosen worked in Building 20, a site of antiwar
protests during the 1960s because the school's ROTC and several programs funded
by the Defense Department were there.
</P>
<P>
"I felt like a turkey, because here I was working my butt off and I thought
doing good work, and these guys would come around and accuse me of being a
warmonger," Rosen said in the 2004 interview.
</P>
<P>
He left the Lincoln Laboratory in 1977 and spent three years as head of the
Defense Communications Agency. He returned to the Lincoln Laboratory in 1980 and
spent four years there before retiring.
</P>
<P>
Rosen went back to school in the early 1970s for a second master's degree in
psychiatric counseling from Boston University and volunteered as a crisis and
intervention responder in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, he moved to Deerfield Beach, Fla., and taught courses on existentialism
for senior citizens at Lynn University in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
He had lived in Silver Spring, Md., since 2006.
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife of 66 years, Annette Braverman Rosen of Silver
Spring; three children, Mark Rosen of Auburn, Calif., Bruce Rosen of Newton,
Mass., and Elliot Rosen of Takoma Park, Md.; a sister; a brother; and five
grandchildren.
