The British government said Tuesday the spate of abductions of aid workers in
Mindanao, particularly in the provinces of Zamboanga, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, has
created "an atmosphere of fear and reluctance," jeopardizing the delivery of
services to the people in these conflict-torn areas.

<P>
According to a statement released by the embassy on Tuesday, Chris Wright, head
of political section of the British Embassy, expressed concern that aid workers
have become targets of terrorism and kidnappings by lawless elements in
Mindanao.

<P>
"Mindanao remains a priority area for development programs because of its
current socio-economic and political conditions. Most of the workers involved in
these programs are leaving the comfort of their own homes and spending time away
from their families to help people in areas of conflict where their safety is
compromised every day. Yet they continue because they know their mission is very
important," Wright said in the statement.

On Jan. 15, Abu Sayyaf gunmen snatched ICRC workers Eugenio Vagni of Italy,
Andreas Notter of Switzerland and Filipina Mary Jean Lacaba after inspecting a
jail water sanitary project in Jolo. All three have been released after months
in captivity.

<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, which is believed to have links with the Al- Qaeda terrorist
network, is in the U.S. government's foreign terrorist organization list. The
group has claimed responsibility for several terror attacks in the country and
is notorious for kidnapping foreigners in exchange for huge ransom.

Experts from the United Kingdom trained this week Philippine and foreign aid
workers assigned to places with the highest level of threat in the Philippines.
John Walker, one of the trainers, emphasized the need to help susceptible
individuals such as development workers to protect themselves from abduction.
</P>
<P>
Funded by the British government, the training is aimed at addressing their
security needs in areas vulnerable to kidnap- for- ransom activities.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this training, which has been provided by the same organization that
trains members of the U.K. government for deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan,
will help committed aid workers keep themselves safe while they work to improve
the lives of the people of Mindanao," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
Held in Zamboanga City, the training was a result of a series of roundtable
discussions with different institutions and government agencies to offer aid
workers tools to deal with potential dangers that come with their line of work
without compromising their commitment to assist others in need.
