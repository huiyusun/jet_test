<P>
The series of high-profile organized crime trials in southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality have proved just the tip of the iceberg in a nationwide battle
against crime gangs.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, southwest China's Guizhou Province, published 10 e-mail addresses for
the public to report gang-related crimes on the website of its public security
department.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou police dealt with at least seven gang crime cases within 20 days in an
intensive crackdown last month.
</P>
<P>
Police in Hunan Province, in central China, was also reported to have broken up
three major criminal gangs in its Xiangxi prefecture this year.
</P>
<P>
Across Hunan, 73 officials were found to have shielded or been directly engaged
in gang-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
Other provinces such as Gansu and Anhui were also intensifying the fight against
organized crime gangs.
</P>
<P>
China's police launched a long-term campaign against criminal gangs in 2006. As
of September, more than 1,200 cases of gang crimes have been dealt with across
the country, with more than 13,000 criminal gangs broken up and at least 89,000
people arrested.
</P>
<P>
The revelations of police officials in collusion with criminals in Chongqing
Municipality that started in June have heightened coverage of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Mayor Wang Hongju revealed on Sunday that at least 200 local
judicatory officials had been found to be involved in organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
Wen Qiang, former deputy director of Chongqing's public security department, was
found to have shielded criminal gangs and committed other crimes while holding
his post.
</P>
<P>
Wen will be prosecuted later this month in connection with the offences of rape,
money laundering, disguising or concealing the proceeds of crime, illegally
holding firearms, offering loans at high interest, forging official and
corporate seals, introducing women to prostitution and taking bribes.
</P>
<P>
Wen's sister-in-law, organized crime boss Xie Caiping, was sentenced to 18 years
in prison after a first-instance trial last week.
</P>
<P>
Xie, labeled the "godmother of the underworld" in Chongqing, was convicted of
organizing and leading a criminal organization, running gambling dens, illegal
imprisonment, harboring people taking illegal narcotics and giving bribes to
officials.
</P>
<P>
Another 21 people in Xie's case, including officials who offered protection to
gang members, were given jail terms ranging from one to 13 years in sentences
handed down at the Chongqing No. 5 Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing's procuratorate has issued arrest warrants for more than 800 suspects
in the municipality's crackdown on gang-related crimes, and more than 320 people
have been prosecuted so far.
</P>
<P>
At least 52 local officials have been investigated or punished for shielding
criminal gangs in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yongkang, member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee Political Bureau, pledged in late October that the campaign
would continue until criminal gangs were eradicated.
</P>
<P>
Zhou urged a relentless investigation of any official providing a "protective
umbrella" for organized crime.
