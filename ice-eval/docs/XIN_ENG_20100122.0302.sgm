Prosecutors in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality said Friday they had
officially charged a former police officer with taking bribes and protecting
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Wen Qiang, former deputy director of Chongqing's public security department, was
also accused of rape and being unable to explain the sources of his assets,
according to a statement published on the website of the municipal
procuratorate, www.cqjcy.gov.cn.

<P>
Prosecutors said investigations showed Wen had abused his power by offering
benefits to others and accepted huge bribes personally or with his wife Zhou
Xiaoya when he served in a series of Communist Party of China and administrative
posts at the Public Security Bureau of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
He had also covered up or allowed organized crime led by notorious gangleaders,
including Xie Caiping, Wang Tianlun and Gong Gangmo, and received bribes from
them.

<P>
The statement did not reveal the amount of bribes or his unidentified assets.

<P>
Wen's wife and three other police officers involved in the case also faced
prosecution.

Wen was among many high-ranking local officials prosecuted during a massive
crackdown against organized crimes started in June last year, which exposed deep
ties between police and criminals.

In addition, former head of the city's traffic police Chen Honggang, former vice
director of Chongqing's public security department Peng Changjian, and former
vice general manager of the Development and Management Co. Ltd. of Chongqing's
bonded zone Liu Xinyong, were also prosecuted in separate cases on corruption
charges.

Chongqing police have detained 1,176 people and prosecuted 782 people, including
78 gangs, allegedly involved in organized crimes over the past six months,
according to the statement.

A total of 87 officials have been prosecuted during the crackdown, including 12
high-ranking officials.
