According to the Jana report, Libyan Transport Minister Mohammed Ali Zidan on

-- a transliteration from the Arabic name stated in the report -- at al-Khadraa
hospital after he recovered consciousness following the surgery to repair
several fractures in both legs.

Dr. Hamida al-Sahli, head of the child care unit at the hospital, told Jana that
the child had suffered bleeding before the surgery because of several fractures
in both legs.
