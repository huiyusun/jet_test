<P>
Leaders of Jewish groups in Cuba denied on Wednesday they have any contact with
jailed U.S. contractor Alan Gross, who was arrested a year ago over charges of
spying.
</P>
<P>
Adela Dworin, vice president of the "Jewish Patronage," said, "I am very sorry
for what happened to Gross," adding that "the saddest thing is that he wanted to
engage the Jewish community, which is totally strange to his activities."
</P>
<P>
Mayra Levy, official from the Havana Sephardic Hebrew Center, said she had never
met Gross and he never visited the institution.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some 1,500 Jews live in Cuba with most of them in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Gross was arrested on Dec. 3, 2009, at the Havana airport for allegations of
providing Internet satellite communication equipment to the anti-Castro groups
based on the island.
</P>
<P>
Though he has been imprisoned for a year, he has not been officially charged
yet.
</P>
<P>
U.S. calls for his release on humanitarian grounds and ensured that Gross was
only providing Internet connection to the Cuban Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
The detainee's wife, Judy Gross, wrote in August to Cuban President Raul Castro
to express regrets for her husband's work in Cuba. Cuban authorities have
allowed Gross's wife to visit him at least once at a military hospital in Havana
where he was detained.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Gross has criticized the White House for not doing enough and described her
husband as "a victim caught in the crossfire between the two foes of the old
Cold War."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department dismissed recently an alleged plan to exchange Gross
with one of the five Cubans imprisoned since 1998 in the United States under
espionage charges. The case has been handled by officials of both countries when
they met in Havana and Washington on migration and other bilateral issues.
