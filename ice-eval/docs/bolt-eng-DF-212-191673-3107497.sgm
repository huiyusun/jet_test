Didn't want to highjack TH's Sinkex thread. While looking up ships I had been on I found that 2 are in other Navies now and thought I'd post "Before and After" pics.

Any one else looked up some of their ships?

First one USS Saganaw LST-1188 now HMAS Kanimbla LPA-51

Second USS P-cola LSD-38 now the Chinese Hsu Hai LSD-193

Great thread idea!! <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>

Let's see what I can find...

USS Newport (LST-1179) sold to Mexico, renamed Papaloapan (P-411).
In her Mexican Navy incarnation, she was sent to the Gulf Coast to help out with Katrina aid.

Hmmm. Interesting. I didn't think the Kidd class (DDG 993, 994, 995 &amp; 996) would be given up so soon. They have the full armor addition (Ingalls concept with sandwiched Kevlar) and their hulls are more carefully built at the Sonar dome attachment in accordance with Iranian specifications when the Shah originally ordered them.

Actually I'm rather surprised somebody hadn't snapped them up sooner.

The USN doesn't want/need them anymore and they're far too valuable (compared to a Spruance-class) as a saleable asset to smaller countries to be deep-sixed as quickly as the Spru-cans.

I know Australia was considering them (or had been offered them) and I think maybe Greece was mentioned as well.

It's too bad really, I've always like the Kidds. But those Mark 26's are just too passé I guess (no Tomahawk/Standard ER or later), what with the Baseline 0/1 Tico's getting decomm'ed. I wonder how long before a For Sale sign is hung on their bows. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/frown.gif"/>

Of course, affordability could be a problem... <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/redface.gif"/>

In all seriousness, the Coast Guard is in desperate need of new hulls.
It's a shame that the Pegasus-class hydrofoils were ditched so early.

They could have landed all of the Harpoon canister launchers and turned those honies into go-fast boat hunter/killers.

I'd like to see the Dept. of Homeland Security reuse the retiring LHA ships as disaster response vessels. Two on each coast could support coast guard helo operations and put relief to shore pretty quickly.

They wouldn't need the major firepower, and they would make a good platform for deploying small boat teams to coast regions hard to reach by land after hurricanes.

That is an EXCELLENT idea. I know their triage and hospital facilities are second only to a full fledged hospital ship and they have the helicopter facilities for rapid medical transport as well as supporting rescue and recon ops. I worked on some improvements needed to the med facilities on those ships right after they were delivered from Ingalls. Not that Ingalls forgot to install them, just that they were late Shipalts with late funding that was not enough to cover Ingalls' Change Order charges. So the Navy yards got a crack at them instead.

They can carry 1200 Marines so that berthing area can be medical wards for patients with less than dire medical needs.

Communications spaces can be turned into a great 911 center to monitor and/or control dispatch of emergency personnel. Being a ship and if buoyed far enough off shore, cutting the moor and putting full power on the twin screws could allow the ship to ride on up and over an incoming tsunami. A major earthquake would only rattle a couple of small items off the shelves.

Only a direct hit from a locomotive sized asteroid could take it out.

Kidds were offer to Greece, but they didn't have the money to run 9000t destroyers. They opted for the Hydra class frigates.

The first 5 Ticos were offer to the Royal Navy as a stop gap measure to replace the retiring Type 42s, before the commissioning of the Type 45s. I guess they didn't want them because they want to spend as much money as possible on new hulls rather than rent old ones.

These Ticos should still be pretty good for many navies in the world. Too bad no one can afford them, or willing to afford them.

I didnt know that - interesting stuff. I can see why they rejected them, money being so tight for the RN, but in times that were more demanding, it would have been a sensible solution.

(Mind you, I would have retired the Type 42's in 1986, sold them to Brazil, and looked into building a UK version of the Burkes, with Aegis).

That I didn't know, but it doesn't surprise me a great deal. Both that they were offered to the RN and that they were turned down. Probably a good thing at the end of the day. Besides, they'd have a hell of time changing the appropriate signage to British English. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

Great idea. But not sure what kind of shape they will be in when they get to retire.
I was on the Siapan 6 years ago and she was pretty beat up.

Maybe they could be transferred to the Fleet reserve or MSC. One last trip to the yard for refurbish. Preserve and seal off all the unnecessary spaces and have a Reserve/MM crew. Two per coast might be overkill though.

I keep pushing the idea of the USA having an intregrated Security Force of some sort for CT, disaster relief, emergency responce and border protection work, maybe if you lot merged all the disparate organisations like customs, the border patrol, the USCG, the CAP, the federal protective service etc. you could find the money to invest in some ex-USN heavy lifting for just those roles.
I wouldn't mind seeing a smaller Security Force formed in Australia for the same purpose but I know that'll never happen no matter how much we need it. Still, the whole 'ADF and ASF' thing has a nice ring to it...

How so GG? I've always wondered what problems a "worn out" ship has.

That wouldn't work. You don't understand our bureaucracy. Size and complexity of the government, along with inefficiency, can only go up, not down. That's a law.

In theory, the Department of Homeland Whatever merges Border Patrol, Coast Guard, INS, FBI, Barney Fife, and the rent-a-cops at the mall all into one lean mean law enforcement machine.

This couldn't be farther from the truth.

The inter agency rivalry is still there. Everyone is fighting for a bigger budget. The whole aparatus isn't any more efficient, just bigger, with an additional cabinet position along with all his support staff (Secratary of Homeland Security) on top of the chiefs already in place for those various agencies.

I have no idea how this can be fixed. All I can do is criticize.

Well, on a side note, take a look at the sides of a Kidd when it belonged to the USN and take a look at the sides of a Burke, now. Notice something? Kidd's had nice size motor whale boats, a Gig, but now, all that has gone the way of the zodiaks. For some reason............ EVERYONE wanted those zodiaks instead of the 'cumbersome' MWB's, UBoat's, Gigs.

She served well. Including being at Pearl during the raid. Alot of the U.S. cruisers (heavy &amp; light) IMO served well during WWII yes we had some losses (Indianapollis) and few others but overall I believed they served their needs for the time. My opinion... The Belgrano (ex Phoenix) should have never been there. Argentina should have known the Brits would have subs in the area having to come that distance to defend the Faulklands should have told Argentina the Brits would bring other toys to the game thus not go home "empty handed". Obviously they must have figured the Brits would only bring surface combatants. Its still debatable whether it was the right decision or not but what are you going to do when you are at war?. I know the lawsuites have hung around for awhile but havent heard anything lately. Anybody know of any updates lately?

Probably due to lighter, faster, easier and faster to deploy and probably as well store. Also another thought...The Zodiak doesnt sit as low in the water as a regular launch,barge or Capts gig. The Zodiak would also take a fraction of the time to repair although definately a lil wetter upfront then the gig <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/>

Ok heres one. DD168 Maddox. Served with the USN until 1941. Then transfered to the Royal Navy as HMS Georgetown under the lend/lease plan and then a further transfer to the Russian Navy as Doblistni and then returned to the Royal Navy again in 1952. Hows that for a go around? <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>

Or this one which has much more signifigance to the British fleet. Again a gift from America's lend lease agreement of 50 destroyers for bases/air strips currently under British ownership.

DD - 131 Buchanan
Most widely known of the 50, Renamed HMS Campbeltown she was chosen for the raid on St. Nazaire France. Being disguised as a german destroyer and packed with explosives she was rammed into the gate of the Normandie Dry Dock in St. Nazaire and when the charges went off the dry dock gate was blown off and the dock was rendered unusable to the Germans.

The Normandie Dry Dock was the only dry dock outside of Germany that was large enough to accommodate the German Battleship Tirpitz, Keep her maintained and repaired for Atlantic Operations. As a result of the raid and destruction of the Campbeltown, the Tirpitz never left Norwegian waters and was never able to operate in the Atlantic. Campbeltown was destroyed in the raid on March 28 1942.

This photo taken just before detination on the sill of the Normany dry dock. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/>

Id say that lil DD paid for herself and the other 50 DD's right there. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/redface.gif"/>

Not a US ship but I'm sure no one will mind... <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>

HMS Venerable -&gt; sold to the Dutch and became the Karel Doorman. Which was then sold to the Argentinians and became the Veinticinco de Mayo. Another ship with a "few homes"... She would probably have been sunk by RN nuke subs had she not run back to port after the Belgrano... Second pic is of her as Veinticinco de Mayo (hence the colour)...

EDIT - should add that HMS Vengeance of the same class ended up as the Minas Gerais of Brazil via the RAN

And Warrior went to Argentina as well - via the RCN - as the Independencia.

Probably all true, however...............

LOL You dont have to tell me about how rough it gets on a Zod I know all to well. I would still opt for the launch when ferrying in open water. Atleast they have a small bow to break the rollers coming at you. Zods are more or less made for inland waters bays and rivers but certainly not for open ocean way too rough and I'm sure the Commadore didnt like the bath either. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>

The KIDD-class (also known as the SHAH-class) also differed from the SPUANCEs in that their sea-water inlet systems had a more advanced sand filtration system. They were designed to work in shallower water. I don't know if or how that affected their blue water capability.

Limitations aside, it is a pretty good suggestion, but it's not the first something like that has been made.

USNI Proceedings had an article similar to such during the Cold War of emergency aid ships that would be at sea during the missile exchange and then come back, afterwards. Since, in that scenario, repopulation would be an issue, mixed crews were part of the topic.

Actually, the British did announce that they were sending their 'nuclear subs' ahead of their surface fleet. This was done at the same time Britain announced the two hundred mile exclusion zone.
The biggest help to the Royal Navy was the satellite coverage supplied by the USA. The second greatest was the Sidewinder-9L missile and the Red Flag type exercise held with the French AF to determine the best way for Harrier pilots to deal with the Mirage-3.

I know, not US NAVY But:

Majestic Class Aircraft Carriers (initially intended to be part of the Colossus-class, but were instead built to a modified design):

* Hercules - She was launched in 1942, yet was neglected for 10 years until bought by India. She was commissioned into the Indian Navy in 1961, being named INS Vikrant.
* Leviathan - She was launched in 1945, though never completed. Her boilers were removed for the Argentine carrier ARA Veinticinco de Mayo, a Colossus-class carrier. Leviathan was scrapped in 1968.
* Magnificent - Once completed, she was loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy. Broken up, late 1960s.
* Majestic - Sold to Australia, becoming the flagship of the Royal Australian Navy, being renamed HMAS Melbourne. She was broken up in 1985.
* Powerful - Launched in 1945 and subsequently purchased by Canada in 1952. She was renamed HMCS Bonaventure and was scrapped in Taiwan in 1971.
* Terrible - She was launched in 1944, and was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy, under the name of HMAS Sydney in 1948. She was broken up in 1975

Obviously they must have figured the Brits would only bring surface combatants. Its still debatable whether it was the right decision or not but what are you going to do when you are at war?........

Comme ce, Comme ca. IMHO, two issues. First of all, there is a question of how hard they expected the Brits to fight for the island. "what are you going to do when you are at war?" Maybe they didn't expect the Brit's really to go to war. After all, maybe a lot of people didn't expect how far it would go. When the Sheffield was hit, one of the news magazine headlines was on the lines of "A little war turns nasty" (wtte).

Secondly, a primary belief in war, at least for some, is to make the other guy want to stop fighting. Obviously, if you kill him, that is accomplished. But more than that, it is to shock him to how bad war is, to make him go back to the negotiation table. That shock is known as THUNDERCLAP. Thunderclap might be, for example, nuking his leading city (maybe not the capital because you want the negotiation teams) on the first day of the war.

But sinking a high price item, such as a cruiser for such a country, is a version of THUNDERCLAP. You make the war VERY expensive for him.

Whether sinking the cruiser achieved the purpose of THUNDERCLAP is debateable. But it did accomplish one thing. Having lost the cruiser, they kept the carrier in port so not to chance losing it, too.

Here is a older Knox class FF-1052, now sold to many nations. One of the nations to get a few of them was Taiwan.
