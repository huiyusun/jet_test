US student has her day in Italian court over sex-murder
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PERUGIA, Italy, June 12, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American student Amanda Knox exuded confidence Friday as she rejected charges
that she helped kill her British housemate after group sex play turned violent
in an Italian university town.
</P>
<P>
Accusing police of hitting and bullying her to force her to make false
statements, Knox said she had spent the night of the November 2007 sex-murder at
the home of her Italian boyfriend of two weeks, Raffaele Sollicito.
</P>
<P>
"The declarations were taken against my will," said Knox, 21, taking the stand
for the first time since the trial began in January, asserting that her
interrogators repeatedly called her a "stupid liar."
</P>
<P>
"Everything I said was said in confusion and under pressure and because they
were suggested by the (investigators)," she added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether police had hit her before she stated that the victim, Meredith
"Mez" Kercher of Coulsdon, England, had been raped, she replied "yes."
</P>
<P>
Knox also said harsh questioning had pushed her to state that she was at home at
the time of the murder and could hear Kercher scream, and to accuse her part-
time boss of the crime.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Knox said Friday, she spent the night with Sollecito at his flat, where
they smoked marijuana, had sex and watched a movie.
</P>
<P>
The two, who face 30 years in prison if convicted, have been held since a few
days after Kercher was found semi-nude with her throat cut in the house in the
walled medieval town of Perugia that she shared with Knox.
</P>
<P>
The lurid headlines in Britain and Knox's hometown of Seattle, Washington,
sparked fears that she would not have a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that the 22-year-old victim was murdered after refusing to
join in an orgy on the night of November 1, 2007, along with 20-year-old Rudy
Guede, from Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
While claiming innocence, Guede, who worked as a casual labourer here, opted for
a "fast-track" trial and has already been convicted and sentenced to 30 years
for his role in the murder.
</P>
<P>
In the prosecutors' scenario, Guede held Kercher down while Sollecito and Knox
stabbed her.
</P>
<P>
Guede was quoted in Friday's Italian press as saying from his prison cell: "You
were there, Amanda, tell the truth."
</P>
<P>
Testifying in a clear, confident voice in fluent Italian, sometimes laughing or
gesticulating, Knox explained her nickname "Foxy Knoxy" as a reference to her
skill at football, which she said she had played since she was a child.
</P>
<P>
Knox, dressed in white with her hair pulled back in a ponytail, said her
relationship with Sollecito was "very special," and that she had fallen in love
with him just two weeks before the murder.
</P>
<P>
Asked about a red area on her neck shown widely in newspaper close-ups after her
arrest, she laughed and said it was a "hickey, a love bite from Raffaele."
</P>
<P>
Knox said her questioners had led her to accuse bar owner and musician Patrick
Lumumba, for whom she worked twice a week, of murdering Kercher.
</P>
<P>
"In my confusion I started to imagine that maybe I was traumatised, like what
they said," she told Lumumba's lawyer Carlo Pacelli.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese Lumumba, who was held for two weeks before being released without
charge, is suing Knox for defamation and was present at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
The defendant said she was "very sorry, gutted, (when she learned) that Patrick
was still in jail because of me."
</P>
<P>
Pacelli later told AFP: "She is a very good actress."
</P>
<P>
Knox's early statement that she covered her ears so as not to hear Meredith's
screams "was true," Pacelli said, insisting that her questioners could not have
suggested that scenario.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Knox said that when she heard that Guede was arrested, "I thought
they would let me go... I felt great relief, but then they kept me in custody."
</P>
<P>
Kercher's family are seeking 30 million euros (40 million dollars) from the
alleged killers.
</P>
<P>
Their lawyer Francesco Maresca dismissed assertions of a bungled investigation,
telling AFP: "The probe was perfect, very good work."
</P>
<P>
He was confident of a conviction in the long-running trial. "All the necessary
elements are in place to arrive at a conviction... probably in October."
</P>
<P>
Both Kercher and Knox had arrived in the normally quiet Umbrian university town
in September 2007.

US student faces tough questioning in Italy sex-murder trial
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
perugia, Italy, June 13, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Amanda Knox faced tough questioning Saturday while testifying for a
second day in a trial over whether she helped kill a British housemate who
refused to join in a group sex session in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Prominent public prosecutor Giuliano Mignini grilled the 21-year-old exchange
student accused of taking part in group sex play that turned violent with the
stabbing death of Meredith Kercher, 22, of Britain.
</P>
<P>
In a testy exchange, Mignini questioned Knox's assertion that interrogators had
extracted false statements from her by bullying her, calling her a "stupid liar"
and even hitting her on the head at one point.
</P>
<P>
Knox gave a description of hours of questioning in which she said that she was
told that if she did not tell the truth they would "throw me in jail for 30
years."
</P>
<P>
Defence lawyers repeatedly objected during Mignini's examination, accusing him
of badgering the witness and asking her leading questions.
</P>
<P>
Mignini focused on Knox's assertions that her false statements -- notably, that
her part-time employer Patrick Lumumba was the killer -- were the result of
"suggestions" during aggressive police questioning.
</P>
<P>
"Was Patrick's name indicated after they saw (her SMS) message (to Lumumba) or
just like that?" Mignini asked, sparking a heated row with the defence team that
judge Giancarlo Massei had difficulty quelling.
</P>
<P>
Knox said she became so confused after "a steady crescendo ... of 'I don't
know,' 'you're a stupid liar,' 'maybes,' and 'imagines' that ... I was led to
believe I had forgotten things."
</P>
<P>
She added: "When I said 'Patrick' I actually started to imagine a kind of movie,
images that could have explained the situation, Patrick's face, then (Perugia's)
Grimana square, then my house" on the night of the murder.
</P>
<P>
Knox had said Friday that harsh questioning had also pushed her to state that
she was at home at the time of the murder and could hear Kercher scream.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Knox said, she spent the night with Sollecito at his flat, where they
smoked marijuana, had sex and watched a movie.
</P>
<P>
The two, who face 30 years in prison if convicted, have been held since a few
days after Kercher was found semi-nude with her throat cut in the house in the
walled medieval town of Perugia that she shared with Knox.
</P>
<P>
The case has sparked lurid headlines in Britain and Knox's hometown of Seattle,
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Publicity over the case has sparked fears that she would not have a fair trial,
and Mignini's motives have been questioned.
</P>
<P>
The powerful prosecutor is currently under indictment for professional
misconduct and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Kercher was murdered after refusing to join in an orgy
on the night of November 1, 2007, along with 20-year-old Rudy Guede, from Ivory
Coast.
</P>
<P>
While claiming innocence, Guede, who worked as a casual labourer here, opted for
a "fast-track" trial and has already been convicted and sentenced to 30 years
for his role in the murder.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The defendant said she was "very sorry, gutted, (when she learned) that Patrick
was still in jail because of me."
</P>
<P>
Lumumba's lawyer Carlo Pacelli told AFP later: "She is a very good actress."
</P>
<P>
Mignini was to be followed later Saturday by a lawyer from Kercher's family, who
are seeking 30 million euros (40 million dollars) from the alleged killers.

Former Pakistan MP held in connection with hostage killing
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ISLAMABAD, July 26, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistani authorities have arrested a former member of parliament in connection
with the murder of a Polish engineer decapitated by Taliban militants in
February, a security official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that Shah Abdul Aziz
was arrested in May over his suspected involvement in the killing and was being
questioned but had not been charged.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested at his home in Karak, a remote town around 100 kilometres (60
miles) south of Peshawar, the capital of Northwest Frontier Province.
</P>
<P>
On July 16, Pakistani police arrested another man, Attaullah, in connection with
the killing and on Sunday arrested three other people suspected of links to
Stanczak's murder and of plotting militant attacks in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
"These suspects were arrested in the light of a statement given by Attaullah
during interrogation," a senior security official said, requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot say at this stage that these people were involved in the murder of
the Polish engineer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Police recovered hand grenades, pistols and ammunition during the raid on their
hideouts in the Barakahu area on the outskirts of Islamabad, he said.
</P>
<P>
Geologist Piotr Stanczak, 42, was working in Pakistan for a Polish oil and
natural gas exploration company when he was seized in the volatile northwest of
the country last September. His abductors killed his driver and his bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
His decapitation on February 7 -- which was filmed by his captors and was the
first of a Pole by Islamic militants -- provoked a furious reaction from Warsaw,
which accused Islamabad of "apathy" over tackling terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Poland has offered a 290,000-dollar reward for information leading to the
capture of the Taliban militants who beheaded Stanczak.
</P>
<P>
Warsaw had also requested US assistance to help capture Stanczak's killers.
</P>
<P>
Poland is a close ally of Washington and has sent hundreds of troops to
Pakistan's neighbour Afghanistan to battle the Taliban there as part of a NATO
force.

Canadian PM dives in sub for Arctic
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa, Aug 19, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper flew a military helicopter around an
iceberg, sailed a warship, and dove in a navy submarine Wednesday, heralding his
country's claim to the resource-rich Arctic.
</P>
<P>
On day three of a five-day visit to the far north, Harper took part in a
military exercise trumpeting Canada's sovereignty over a large Arctic tract east
of Baffin Island, where Russian and US submarines are said to prowl.
</P>
<P>
"With other countries probing our north by sea and in the air, the work you are
doing here to protect our sovereignty has never been more important," Harper
told sailors on the deck of HMCS Toronto.
</P>
<P>
"Protecting national sovereignty, the integrity of our borders, is the first and
foremost responsibility of a national government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Later, Harper zipped across Frobisher Bay to the submarine HMCS Corner Brook and
took its controls as it slipped beneath the icy waters for a 30-minute trip.
</P>
<P>
His office told AFP he took the controls of a large Sea King helicopter as it
flew past an iceberg, and briefly steered the warship HMCS Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Five countries bordering the Arctic -- Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the
United States -- claim overlapping parts of the Arctic, which is estimated to
hold 90 billion untapped barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
Moscow believes it should control the Northern Sea Route, a passage that
stretches from Asia to Europe across northern Russia.
</P>
<P>
In 2007, Russian submariners planted a flag on the ocean floor beneath the North
Pole in a symbolic staking of its claim over the region.
</P>
<P>
Canada, meanwhile, has claimed the famed Northwest Passage, but is at odds with
the United States which considers it to be international waters. The two allies
also cannot agree on the resource-rich Beaufort Sea, which touches both Alaska
and Canada's northern territories.
</P>
<P>
Since becoming prime minister in 2006, Harper has made Canadian sovereignty over
the Arctic a key priority of his government. This is Harper's third trip to the
region as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Canada announced it was stepping up its military alertness along its
northern frontier in response to Russia "testing" its boundaries with military
flights skirting the border, which had not seen since the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa responded with plans for a sensor net, more navy patrols and a military
training camp in the far north.
</P>
<P>
In its fifth year, the annual military exercises are the biggest they have ever
been, and include for the first time anti-submarine measures as well as the
deployment of a new elite Arctic commando unit.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Harper held a cabinet meeting in Iqaluit, Nunavut and dined on seal
in support of Canada's maligned seal trade.
</P>
<P>
He also announced the creation of a northern economic development agency with 50
million Canadian dollars (45 million US) at its disposal to develop northern
infrastructure and aid locals.
</P>
<P>
Later in the week, Harper will travel to the Inuit hamlet Pangnirtung, on Baffin
Island, and to Yellowknife and Whitehorse, the regional capitals of the
Northwest Territories and the Yukon respectively.

Aiming to become the first man in 84 years to win the US Open six years running
and will once again start a strong favourite. Federer has had a remarkable year
to date. He lost to Rafael Nadal in the Australian Open final and failed to win
a tournament in the first five months of the year before completing his career
Grand Slam in the French Open and regaining his Wimbledon crown. He is back to

Winner of a season-best five titles this year, Murray has ended the four-year

is widespread that he is ready to win his first Grand Slam title. Made the final

Nadal's season has been in stark contrast to that of Federer. Dominant at the
start of the year when he won his first Australian Open, the Spaniard paid the
price for his physical exertions when he lost for the first time at Roland
Garros going down to eventual finalist Robin Soderling. He then took 10 weeks
out to heal his aching knees and has been less than convincing on his return to
action. Needs a US Open title to become just the seventh man to win all four

The giant Argentinian is the youngest player currently in the top 10 and his
progress has been spectacular over the last year. Took Federer to the limit in
the French Open semi-final before losing in the Wimbledon second round to
Lleyton Hewitt. Won the Washington tournament earlier this month to underline

buildup to Flushing Meadows losing early in Washington before reaching the semi-

the Montreal Masters where he was unlucky to lose to Roddick in a top quality
third round tie. Could be running into form at the right time for New York

Two soldiers wounded in southern Philippine blast: military

zamboanga, Philippines, Aug 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two soldiers were wounded in a bomb explosion in the restive southern Philippine
island of Jolo Sunday, the military said.
</P>
<P>
The improvised explosive device exploded early evening near the airport on Jolo,
in the country's southern tip and a known stronghold of Al-Qaeda-linked Abu
Sayyaf militants, the military said.
</P>
<P>
Both soldiers belonged to the army's engineering brigade. They were being
treated at a military hospital but the extent of their injuries was not readily
known.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for planting the improvised bomb, but previous
attacks have been blamed on the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place amid a stepped up military operation against the group,
which has been blamed for the country's worst terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is believed to have splintered into smaller groups hiding in the
jungles around Jolo. In January, they seized an Italian, a Swiss national and a
Filipina who were on a Red Cross humanitarian mission on the island.
</P>
<P>
Two were freed in April, but the last hostage, Eugenio Vagni of Italy was freed
only after six months in captivity.

Trial of US student accused in Italy sex-murder resumes
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Rome, Sept 14, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trial of US exchange student Amanda Knox accused of killing her British
housemate during a drug-fueled sex game gone awry in 2007 resumed Monday in the
central Italian university town of Perugia.
</P>
<P>
Defence lawyers failed in a bid to have the case thrown out because of a long
delay in being given access to crucial DNA evidence, Italian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Central to the prosecutors' case against Knox and her then boyfriend Raffaele
Sollecito is the supposed murder weapon, a knife found in Sollecito's apartment
allegedly bearing Knox's DNA on the handle and the victim's DNA on the blade.
</P>
<P>
The trial resumed in the medieval walled town after a two-month summer recess.
</P>
<P>
Knox and Sollecito are accused along with a third defendant -- already convicted
and sentenced to 30 years in jail -- of killing 22-year-old Meredith Kercher
after she refused to join in a group sex session.
</P>
<P>
While claiming innocence, Rudy Guede of Ivory Coast, who worked as a casual
labourer in Perugia, had opted for a so-called "fast-track" trial limited to
evidence from the probe.
</P>
<P>
Both Knox and Sollecito have been held since a few days after Kercher was found
semi-nude in a pool of blood with her throat cut in the house in Perugia that
she shared with Knox.
</P>
<P>
In the prosecutors' scenario, Guede held Kercher down while Sollecito and Knox
stabbed her.
</P>
<P>
Kercher's family are seeking 30 million euros (40 million dollars) from the
alleged killers.
</P>
<P>
Two judges and six jurors will decide the fate of Knox and Sollecito, who face
30 years in prison if convicted. A verdict is expected later in the year.

China's judiciary embroiled in graft scandals
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
beijing, Oct 6, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"To get rich is glorious" has been the mantra in booming communist China for 30
years, but few have embraced the slogan more vigorously than Wen Qiang, a
leading law official in the country's southwest.
</P>
<P>
Wen, a former head of the judiciary and ex-vice police chief in Chongqing,
amassed assets valued at over 100 million yuan (14.7 million dollars), but now
stands accused of protecting crime bosses in exchange for gifts and kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old is one of dozens of top judicial officials, including the former
vice head of China's top court, ensnared in high-stakes graft scandals despite
repeated Communist Party pledges and campaigns to stamp out corruption.
</P>
<P>
President Hu Jintao has said corruption is threatening the legitimacy of the
party, and the subject was a major focus of last month's annual meeting of its
key central committee, but observers say anti-graft efforts are falling short.
</P>
<P>
"When people like the vice head of the Supreme Court are accepting bribes and
engaging in corruption, you can draw your own conclusions over how serious the
corruption in China's judiciary is," Beijing lawyer Mo Shaoping told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption in the judiciary is pretty serious."
</P>
<P>
Wen, who became Chongqing's top judicial official last year after 16 years on
the police force, stands accused of protecting an intricate web of businessmen,
officials and mobsters in the city of over 30 million people.
</P>
<P>
According to state media, he has been charged with shielding businesses in
numerous sectors such as real estate, transportation, gambling and prostitution
as well as an illegal loan racket worth 30 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Up to 2,000 suspects have been placed under investigation in the case. At least
two dozen top city officials have been caught up in the crackdown, including the
vice president of Chongqing's high court, Zhang Tao.
</P>
<P>
"What is more shocking than Wen Qiang's ties with businessmen and the mafia is
the role which government officials at all levels played," the China Youth Daily
said in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
"If a string of government officials from top to bottom had not been linked
together to form bridges, then Wen Qiang would not have had the power nor the
ability to establish such a protection umbrella."
</P>
<P>
Just after Wen's case came to light, the ruling party expelled Huang Songyou,
the disgraced former vice head of China's Supreme People's Court, who was placed
under investigation for graft last year.
</P>
<P>
Huang, 51, allegedly helped to resolve a 400-million-yuan real estate case in
exchange for a large kickback when he was a top court official in southern
Guangdong province in the late 1990s, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
"The big issue for China is corruption -- corruption is related to the fact
there is no checks and balances mechanism on power," Joseph Cheng, a political
scientist at City University of Hong Kong, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"This is related to the party wanting to maintain a monopoly on political power
and not being ready to adopt restraints on power. So it is a vicious circle that
is not allowing them to effectively fight corruption."
</P>
<P>
In its latest efforts to stamp out graft, the ruling party has said it will now
require officials to disclose their assets and their family's employment
situation, according to state media.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said disclosure would be helpful, but suggested that greater freedom in
the press to report on official corruption and more oversight from the nation's
rubber-stamp parliament would make anti-graft efforts more effective.
</P>
<P>
Mo, a high-profile Beijing rights lawyer whose firm often handles compensation
cases tied to land acquisition, said corruption was rife in both civil and
criminal courts, though bribery in civil cases was more common.
</P>
<P>
Top court officials in Beijing as well as Guangdong, Hubei and Liaoning
provinces have recently been convicted for taking money from attorneys in
exchange for favourable rulings.
</P>
<P>
The former vice head of Beijing's western district court, 58-year-old Guo
Shengqui, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve for taking bribes and
kickbacks from real estate developers and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The two-year reprieve means that Guo's death penalty could be commuted to life
in prison if he behaves in prison and expresses remorse for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
"You can know the law and you can have a clear-cut case, but if the court is
really corrupt, then the law does not matter," said Mo.

Chronology of Abu Sayyaf kidnappings in the Philippines
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Manila, Oct 12, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf group, which was set up in the 1990s allegedly with seed money
from Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network, has been blamed for a string of
kidnappings in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Police also said they suspected the Abu Sayyaf may be responsible for the
kidnapping on Sunday of an Irish priest, Michael Sinnott, 78, in the troubled
south of the country.
</P>
<P>
Here is a chronology of the highest-profile kidnappings carried out by the Abu
Sayyaf, or gangs linked to it:
</P>
<P>
January 15, 2009: International Committee of the Red Cross workers Andreas
Notter of Switzerland, Eugenio Vagni of Italy and Filipina Mary Jean Lacaba are
kidnapped while on a humanitarian mission on Jolo island. Notter and Lacaba were
freed in April, while Vagni was released in July.
</P>
<P>
June 2008: Popular local television news anchor Ces Drilon and two crew members
seized and held for several days while working on a story about the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
June 2007: Italian priest Giancarlo Bossi of the Pontifical Institute of Foreign
Missions is kidnapped by men with ties to the Abu Sayyaf. He is freed a month
later allegedly after a ransom payment, which he denied.
</P>
<P>
October 2001: Italian priest Giuseppe Pierantoni of the Sacred Heart order is
kidnapped by men with links to Abu Sayyaf. He was freed after six months in
captivity, during which he said he lived off snake and lizard meat.
</P>
<P>
May 2001: Abu Sayyaf rebels raid the Dos Palmas beach resort on Palawan island,
abducting 20 people, including American missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham,
and compatriot Guillermo Sobero. Sobero was beheaded the following month, while
Martin Burnham and a Filipina nurse also held captive were killed a year later
in a military rescue. Gracia was freed in the rescue operation. The other 16
hostages were released earlier after ransoms were paid.
</P>
<P>
August 2000: Jeffrey Schilling, an American convert to Islam, walked into an Abu
Sayyaf lair on Jolo island after marrying a Filipino Muslim woman he met on the
Internet. The bride turned out be related to an Abu Sayyaf rebel. He was rescued
by the military after more than six months.
</P>
<P>
April 2000: Abu Sayyaf militants launch a daring cross-border raid, abducting 21
European and Asian hostages from a resort in Sipadan, Malaysia. All were freed
one after the other in a year-long hostage crisis that also saw many foreign
journalists covering the crisis being kidnapped and released.
</P>
<P>
September 1998: Italian priest Luciano Benedetti is kidnapped and released after
eight weeks in captivity, reportedly only after a ransom was paid.

Knox flirtation changed course of probe: defence
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
perugia, Italy, Dec 1, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A flirtatious gesture by US student Amanda Knox caught an investigator's eye and
changed the course of the probe into the 2007 sex murder of her housemate, a
defence lawyer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Without the famous come-on... she wouldn't be here today" standing trial for
the slaying of Briton Meredith Kercher, said Carlo Dalla Vedova.
</P>
<P>
Investigators say that the day after the gruesome murder of 21-year-old Kercher,
Knox swivelled her hips suggestively while donning anti-contamination shoe-
covers at the scene of the crime.
</P>
<P>
Presenting closing arguments just three days ahead of the expected verdict in
the sensational trial, Dalla Vedova said the media frenzy it sparked had
vilified Knox and invaded her privacy.
</P>
<P>
Raising his voice, Dalla Vedova said: "Amanda is a wholesome young woman!"
</P>
<P>
Knox, 22, dressed in black with her hair pulled back in a single French braid,
listened impassively as her parents Curt Knox and Edda Mellas, seated behind
her, followed proceedings with the help of an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
Curt Knox told reporters afterward that Dalla Vedova's summing up was "another
step in the right direction," the ANSA news agency reported. "We hope to take
another step forward tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
The defence will complete its closing arguments on Wednesday, with rebuttals
scheduled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Knox and her co-defendant, former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 25, have been in
custody since a few days after the murder of the 21-year-old exchange student
from Coulsdon, south of London, on November 1, 2007.
</P>
<P>
Kercher, an aspiring teacher, was found semi-nude with multiple stab wounds to
her neck in her bedroom the following morning.
</P>
<P>
She and Knox, both students at Perugia's prestigious University for Foreigners,
shared a cottage in the hilltop Umbrian city with two Italian women who were
away for the holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Kercher refused to join in a drug-fuelled sex game in which Knox
was the driving force, conducting a "crescendo of violence" that led to
Kercher's brutal death.
</P>
<P>
They have said DNA and other forensic evidence incriminate Knox and Sollecito
and have requested life sentences for the pair.
</P>
<P>
The slaying dented the university's reputation, while residents are eager for
the end of the trial, which began in January.
</P>
<P>
"It has caused real chaos," one student told AFP.
</P>
<P>
She was among a dozen students around a long table at a pizzeria in the centre
of the medieval walled city who said she thought Knox was guilty. Another three
said she was innocent, while one abstained from the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
The defence argued Monday that all evidence pointed to a sole killer, Rudy
Guede, an Ivorian immigrant convicted separately of the grisly crime in a so-
called "fast-track" trial limited to evidence from the probe.
</P>
<P>
Kercher's family is seeking 25 million euros (37 million dollars) in damages
from Knox, Sollecito and Guede.
</P>
<P>
Knox also faces a defamation suit from her former employer, Congolese bar owner
Patrick Lumumba, who was held for two weeks after she accused him under
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
Knox charged that aggressive police questioning led her to accuse Lumumba of the
murder.
</P>
<P>
Dalla Vedova noted Tuesday that the Italian state had already paid damages of
8,000 euros to Lumumba, and that Knox had said "'I'm sorry' so many times, and
'I don't know how I can look Lumumba in the eye'."
</P>
<P>
But Lumumba's lawyer Carlo Pacelli slammed the remarks, saying Knox had told her
mother, in a recorded conversation 10 days after the murder, that "she felt
terrible because she accused Patrick knowing he was innocent."
</P>
<P>
Pacelli told AFP: "But she didn't go to the police, or the magistrate or anyone
else to change her declaration."
</P>
<P>
Two judges and six jurors are expected to reach a verdict late Friday.

Family vows to get US student Knox out of Italian jail
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mother of US student Amanda Knox said Monday that she promised her daughter
that "we will fight" for her release, as the young woman began serving a 26-year
prison term for murdering her British housemate in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Edda Mellas was able to visit her jailed daughter over the weekend, hours after
Knox was convicted by two judges and six Italian jurors of murdering British
exchange student Meredith Kercher in the cottage the two young women shared in
Perugia, Mellas said in an interview with US television.
</P>
<P>
"You will get out of here. Don't worry. Keep your chin up and have courage,"
Mellas said she told her 22-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
"We need to be strong for Amanda. We will fight for her and she will get out of
here," Mellas told ABC television.
</P>
<P>
Knox's family was present when the verdict was read out, but not speaking
Italian, they were able to glean only from the reaction of others in the Perugia
courtroom that the young woman had been found guilty.
</P>
<P>
"I heard someone gasping in the audience, back where the public stood," Mellas
said.
</P>
<P>
"I heard, 'No, no.' Then I heard other people weeping back in the public area
and I thought, 'wow,'" said Mellas.
</P>
<P>
"And then I could see Amanda. She put her head down and she started to cry," an
emotional Mellas said.
</P>
<P>
"I cried. Some of the lawyers were crying. It was chaos," Mellas said.
</P>
<P>
Knox was sentenced last week to 26 years in jail and co-defendant Raffaele
Sollecito, her new boyfriend at the time of the murder two years ago, received a
sentence of 25 years for their roles in Kercher's murder.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors presented DNA and other forensic evidence against Knox, Sollecito
and a third person, Rudy Guede of Ivory Coast, who was convicted separately
after opting for a "fast-track" trial in exchange for clemency.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleged that the three young people were high on drugs when they
tried to engage Kercher, 21, in a sex game that turned violent, leaving her dead
with stab wounds to the neck.
</P>
<P>
Knox's family has vowed to appeal the verdict.
</P>
<P>
"We will do whatever it takes to support Amanda," her mother said.
</P>
<P>
"All over the world -- and this isn't just Italy, it's the United States, it's
everywhere -- truly innocent people are found guilty, and this is one of those
cases. She's innocent," Mellas said.

Ex-judicial official to be tried in China mafia case: report
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing, Jan 24, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The top official ensnared in a mafia crackdown in southwest China will go on
trial in February, state press reported Sunday, the latest in a series of
sensational mob trials that have gripped the nation.
</P>
<P>
Wen Qiang, a former top judicial official in Chongqing municipality, will be
tried on February 2, as the city of over 30 million seeks to wrap up scores of
cases linking the government to organised crime, the China News Service said.
</P>
<P>
Wen, who also served for 16-years as a top Chongqing police official, stands
accused of protecting an intricate web of businessmen, officials and mobsters in
a case involving sordid tales of sex, gambling and graft in the city.
</P>
<P>
Besides being charged with accepting bribes and owning huge amounts of money and
assets he could not explain, Wen, 54, has also been charged with rape, People's
Daily reported last week.
</P>
<P>
Other defendants to be tried with Wen include his wife and at least three top
former Chongqing policemen, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the mafia crackdown in Chongqing began last June, charges have been
brought against 782 people in 78 cases, including 87 government officials, the
report said. Over 3,300 have been detained in the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Wen shielded businesses in numerous sectors such
as real estate, transportation, gambling and prostitution as well as an illegal
loan racket worth 30 billion yuan (4.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
A once defiant Wen -- who amassed assets valued at over 100 million yuan by
allegedly taking kickbacks from crime bosses -- had confessed to his crimes and
expressed remorse since his arrest, the Yangzi Evening News reported last year.
</P>
<P>
He has also confessed to affairs with his female underlings, as well as trysts
with Chinese entertainment starlets, some of whom he allegedly raped, the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
The confession of his infidelities sparked his angry wife to lead police to a
hidden cache of 20 million yuan buried in a remote rural fish pond, numerous
press reports said.
</P>
<P>
Wen's sister-in-law, Xie Caiping, was sentenced to 18 years in prison last year
for running up to 20 gambling dens in Chongqing hotels and paying off police to
turn a blind eye to her criminal activities that included illegal drug use.

Head of US group held in Haiti says 'intentions were good'

Port-au-Prince, Jan 31, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of a US-based charity, who along with nine other members are being held
in Haiti for allegedly trying to take 33 children out of the country, said
Sunday that the group's aims were entirely altruistic.
</P>
<P>
"We came here literally to just help the children. Our intentions were good,"
Laura Silsby, head of an Idaho-based charity called New Life Children's Refuge,
told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to help those who lost parents in the quake or were abandoned," she
said in her detention cell.
</P>
<P>
The director of the Haitian center where the children are being cared for said
earlier Sunday, however, that most of the youngsters insist their parents are
still alive.
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to help children that had no one else to care for them," Silsby
said from the police detention facility near Port-au-Prince's international
airport.
</P>
<P>
The US embassy here said the group were being held for "alleged violations of
Haitian laws related to immigration."
</P>
<P>
Police arrested the five men and five women with US passports, as well as two
Haitians, as they tried to cross into the neighboring Dominican Republic with 33
children late Friday.
</P>
<P>
Silsby declines to provide further details of their detention, and said she did
not know how the group's case would proceed under the Haitian justice system in
the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Haitian officials have voiced fears that child traffickers could take advantage
of the chaos after Haiti's massive January 12 quake to slip out of the country
with children in illegal adoption schemes.
</P>
<P>
There is also concern that legitimate adoption agencies may rush to take
earthquake orphans out of the country before proper checks have been conducted
to confirm their parents perished.

Chinese cop sentenced to death in mafia trial

<TEXT>
<P>
A former police officer in China was sentenced to death on Monday in the latest
court verdict following a huge mafia crackdown that has lifted the lid on
official collusion with gangsters.
</P>
<P>
Yue Cun was convicted of crimes including operating a range of illegal
businesses and causing intentional injury in the huge municipality of Chongqing
in southwestern China, the official China News Service said.
</P>
<P>
At least six people have already been sentenced to death in the sensational
trials in Chongqing, home to 30 million people, but Yue appeared to be the first
police officer given the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Calls to the court went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing crackdown comes amid a nationwide push to stamp out rampant
corruption, which President Hu Jintao has described as one of the greatest
threats to the legitimacy of Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
State press reported last month that the top official ensnared in the crackdown,
Wen Qiang, would go on trial on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wen, 54, is a former top Chongqing police and judicial official who stands
accused of protecting an intricate web of businessmen, officials and mobsters.
</P>
<P>
The trials have grabbed headlines nationwide with their sordid tales of sex,
gambling and graft in the city of 30 million people.
</P>
<P>
Besides being charged with accepting bribes and possessing huge amounts of money
and assets he could not explain, Wen has also been charged with rape, the

Top China justice official in dock on mob charges

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most senior official charged in a major crackdown on organised crime and
graft in southwestern China went on trial Tuesday in the climax of a lurid,
sensational court marathon.
</P>
<P>
Wen Qiang, former director of the justice department in the giant city of
Chongqing, stands accused of accepting bribes, protecting mafia rings and four
counts of rape, a court statement said.
</P>
<P>
He was being tried along with his wife and three top police officials in
proceedings that began early Tuesday and were expected to last five days, said
the statement by the No. 5 Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Wen, 54, along with his wife Zhou Xiaoya, is accused of accepting 15 million
yuan (2.2 million dollars) in bribes.
</P>
<P>
Previous state press reports have alleged that Wen, who was also once a top-
ranked Chongqing police department official, raped a string of women including
B-list film and music starlets.
</P>
<P>
Such lurid details, along with widespread speculation the crackdown was linked
to political manoeuvring at the apex of the ruling Communist Party, have gripped
the nation since trials began late last year.
</P>
<P>
The case has come to symbolise China's struggle against rampant corruption and
expanding organised crime.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party has railed against graft for years, seeking to counter
public anger over regular reports of larcenous officials and stories of excess
and debauchery among party leaders.
</P>
<P>
President Hu Jintao himself has repeatedly warned that graft threatens to
undermine the party's legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown is widely seen as a bid by Bo Xilai -- who was appointed party
secretary of Chongqing in 2007 and is considered one of the party's most popular
and charismatic figures -- to move up in the national hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
Bo, a former commerce minister and son of revolutionary elder Bo Yibo, is
believed to be angling for a spot on the nine-member Politburo Standing
Committee, the top national leadership, said China politics analyst Willy Lam.
</P>
<P>
"Bo Xilai is making a last-ditch bid to get into the Politburo Standing
Committee in 2012. He is 60 years old, so this is probably his last chance,"
said Lam, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At least seven people have been reported executed or sentenced to death in the
trials, which have shocked the public by exposing the impunity enjoyed by mafia
kingpins as they terrorised Chongqing and lived debauched lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
In November, Wen's sister-in-law Xie Caiping, 46, was sentenced to 18 years in
prison on charges ranging from running illegal gambling dens to drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the "Godmother" by Chinese media, Xie reportedly drove a Mercedes-Benz,
owned several luxury villas and kept a stable of 16 young men to provide her
with sexual services.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown also has seen a former senior judge who was awaiting trial, 57
-year-old Wu Xiaoqing, hang himself in jail, state media reports said in
November.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of the public interest in the case, the court received applications
from 72 media organisations from across the nation seeking to attend Wen's
trial, according to cqnews.net, a local Chongqing news website.
</P>
<P>
Crowds were seen outside the venue of Wen's trial on Tuesday but no disturbances
were reported amid heavy security.
</P>
<P>
During previous trials, crowds have gathered outside Chongqing courthouses, with
some claiming to be victims of the mobs and calling for harsh punishment for the
accused, earlier press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Metropolitan Daily, quoting people close to the case, said  Wen's
trial would be open for the first four days but closed on the fifth as it hears
the rape charges, to protect the identity of those involved.
</P>
<P>
It said that despite the reports of Wen assaulting entertainment starlets, he
was likely only to be tried for raping a college student whose name has not been
revealed.

Trial of top China official accused of mob links ends
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing, Feb 7, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trial of a former top Chinese official accused of gangster links, rape and
taking bribes ended Sunday, the court said, bringing to a close the highest-
profile case yet of a huge mafia crackdown.
</P>
<P>
A verdict on the case of Wen Qiang, former justice department director in the
southwestern city of Chongqing, would be announced at an undisclosed, later
date, the No. 5 Intermediate People's Court said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Wen, 54, is the highest-ranking official to appear in the dock in a string of
prosecutions over corruption and mafia crime in the sprawling city that has
gripped the nation with lurid details of sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
At least nine people have been reported executed or sentenced to death in the
trials, which have shocked the public by exposing the impunity enjoyed by mafia
kingpins as they terrorised Chongqing and lived debauched lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
Wen, who was also once a top police official in the city, has been charged with
accepting more than two million dollars in bribes, protecting mafia rings and
four counts of rape, a previous court statement said.
</P>
<P>
The trial began on Tuesday and ended in the early hours of Sunday after hours of
legal sparring.
</P>
<P>
Evidence and testimony related to the allegations of bribery and mafia
protection were heard in open court, but the section devoted to the rape charges
took place behind closed doors, the court statement said.
</P>
<P>
Wen was on trial with four other people, including his wife.
</P>
<P>
A report by the official Xinhua news agency said Wen's lawyer rejected a lot of
the evidence pertaining to alleged bribe-taking, and had pleaded not guilty to
his client protecting mafia rings.
</P>
<P>
According to the China News Service, Wen said in court that much of the money he
received was New Year or birthday gifts. He also denied providing any help to
mafia groups.
</P>
<P>
According to the state-run Beijing News, Wen's lawyer has said a verdict will be
announced after the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, which kicks off on February
13 and ends six days later.
</P>
<P>
In November, Wen's sister-in-law Xie Caiping was sentenced to 18 years in prison
on charges of running illegal gambling dens and drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
She reportedly drove a Mercedes-Benz, owned several luxury villas and kept a
stable of 16 young men to provide her with sexual services.

Taliban claim responsibility for Pakistan suicide attack
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Miranshah, Pakistan, Feb 28, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility on Sunday for a suicide attack on a
police station in the northwestern district of Karak that killed 4 people
including two policemen.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the dead, more than two dozen people were wounded, most of them
police officers, when an attacker detonated a pick-up van on Saturday at the
gate of the main police station in Karak, in North-West Frontier Province.
</P>
<P>
"We have done this," Taliban spokesman Azam Tariq told AFP by telephone from an
undisclosed location. "Both the police and army are equal for us. Both are our
enemies. They are responsible for the cruelties on us. We will carry out more
such attacks against police."
</P>
<P>
Karak lies 150 kilometres (94 miles) southeast of Peshawar, the capital of
North-West Frontier Province.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani Taliban have claimed and been blamed for most of the bomb and
suicide attacks to have taken place in Pakistan. Such attacks have killed more
than 3,000 people since July 2007.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's military has launched a number of offensives against militants in the
tribal belt, which according to the United States has effectively become the
headquarters of Al-Qaeda.

Knox's parents kick off appeal against Italian court decision
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Rome, March 5, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The parents of American Amanda Knox, convicted in the 2007 murder of her British
housemate in Italy, Friday launched an appeal after the judge spelt out his
reasons for sending her to jail for 26 years.
</P>
<P>
"There is a substantial basis for the appeal and we have faith that this will
bring about a reversal of a wrongful conviction," Edda Mellas and Curt Knox said
in a statement carried by the ANSA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Judge Giancarlo Massei said in a legal opinion published Thursday that evidence
presented during the year-long trial gave a "comprehensive and solid picture,
without gaps or inconsistencies" leading to guilty verdicts for Knox and her
then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito.
</P>
<P>
The sensational sex-murder of Briton Meredith Kercher was carried out "with no
planning, no animosity or rancour against the victim," Massei wrote in the
427-page opinion issued three months after the verdict and also signed by co-
judge Beatrice Cristiani.
</P>
<P>
Mellas and Knox said the conviction was "not supported by evidence," and that
the opinion contained "numerous incongrouences and contradictions."
</P>
<P>
"We know our daughter is innocent," they added.
</P>
<P>
"There is no scientific proof that places Amanda in Meredith's room, no proof
that she was on the scene of this terrible crime," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Knox family lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova said Thursday the opinion was "full of
contradictions and unproven assertions."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to AFP by telephone from Perugia, he said: "We are still analysing
it... (but) we will contest the illogical elements," he said, calling for new
scientific tests.
</P>
<P>
Knox, now 22, and Sollecito, an Italian engineering student who is now 25, were
convicted of murdering Kercher, 21, in a drug-fueled sex game that turned
violent on the night of November 1, 2007, in the central university town of
Perugia.
</P>
<P>
A third person, Rudy Guede of Ivory Coast, now 23, had already been convicted
separately in the case under a "fast-track" procedure.
</P>
<P>
Kercher was found semi-nude in a pool of blood under a duvet with multiple stab
wounds to the neck in her room in the cottage she shared with Knox and two other
women, who were away for the long All Saints Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
The crime came about because of a combination of "purely random" circumstances,
notably that both Knox and Sollecito were free that evening, they "ran into"
Guede and went to the house where Kercher was alone, it said.
</P>
<P>
The opinion also asserted that Knox "freely accused Patrick Diya Lumumba of
having killed Meredith and accused him knowing of (his) innocence".
</P>
<P>
Knox was sentenced to 26 years in jail, while Sollecito got 25.
</P>
<P>
The extra year for Knox was in punishment for defaming Lumumba, who spent two
weeks in prison before being released without charge.
</P>
<P>
The Italian court came under harsh criticism from many who felt Knox, a native
of Seattle, Washington, was convicted only on circumstantial evidence and that
the Italian press, which jurors were free to read, had assassinated her
character.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic furore arose after the verdict prompted a senator from Washington
state to charge that Italy's judicial system was "flawed".
</P>
<P>
Knox herself later told a visiting Italian lawmaker that she felt her "rights
were respected" in the trial and that it was "carried out correctly".

US missionary to face trial in Haiti: attorney

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The US woman at the center of a major scandal here after she and several fellow
missionaries tried to spirit dozens of Haitian children into the Dominican
Republic is to be tried in Haiti, her attorney told AFP on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Laura Silsby, one of a group of missionaries from the western US state of Idaho,
was detained at the border with the Dominican Republic on kidnapping charges
following the devastating earthquake in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
She now will stand trial on the charge of arranging "irregular travel,"
according to her attorney, Louis Ricardo Chachoutte, who spoke to reporters
following a court hearing Monday.
</P>
<P>
Silsby and her fellow Baptist missionaries were arrested on January 29 as they
tried to take the children into the neighboring Dominican Republic by bus
without the necessary documentation.
</P>
<P>
Haitian authorities later determined that all 33 children that the US
missionaries tried to remove from the country illegally had parents, with whom
they were eventually reunited.
</P>
<P>
The members of the New Life Children's Refuge missionary group denied
wrongdoing, saying they were only trying to help orphans in the wake of Haiti's
devastating January 12 earthquake that killed more than 220,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The other nine missionaries were all released and allowed to return to the
United States, but Silsby, the leader of the group, remained detained in Port-
au-Prince.

Libya plane crash boy survivor getting better: doctor

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Dutch boy who miraculously survived a Libyan plane crash that killed 103
people, including his parents, greeted relatives with a smile as they arrived to
comfort him, a doctor said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The boy, identified as "Ruben" by the Dutch foreign ministry but more fully by
Dutch media as nine-year-old Ruben van Assouw, is recovering after surgery to
his smashed legs, the doctor treating him in Tripoli said.
</P>
<P>
Dr Siddiq ben Dilla told AFP the boy, who was the sole survivor when the plane
crashed on landing at Tripoli airport on Wednesday, recognised his relatives and
smiled when they entered his hospital room.
</P>
<P>
"His family is with him now," he said. "His memory is good: as soon as his
relatives walked in he smiled, and was happy to see them.
</P>
<P>
"He is getting better, is beginning to talk again and has asked for food,"
Dilla told AFP. "Compared with yesterday he's very good. We have repaired all
his fractures -- effectively several operations in one."
</P>
<P>
Earlier a Dutch foreign ministry spokesman said an uncle and an aunt arrived in
Tripoli on Thursday on a Netherlands government plane and were taken to the
hospital "to make sure that Ruben will see family faces next to his bed."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen said: "He was, of course, after the disaster he
experienced, after the great loss of his parents and brother, happy to see two
familiar faces at his bedside.
</P>
<P>
"His condition is stable but it is not yet possible to transport him," Verhagen
added.
</P>
<P>
The boy's doctor said that if his health continued to improve, he should have
recovered enough to be flown home in the next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
Dutch newspaper Brabants Dagblad said the boy was probably Ruben van Assouw from
Tilburg in the southern Netherlands who had been on safari in South Africa with
his mother Trudy, 41, father Patrick, 40, and brother Enzo, 11.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted his grandmother An van de Sande as saying that the holiday had
been to celebrate the couple's copper wedding anniversary -- marked in the
Netherlands after 12.5 years.
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand. It's like we're in a film," she was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Libyan Transport Minister Mohammed Ali Zidan said a total of 103 people -- 92
passengers of nine nationalities and an 11-strong Libyan crew -- died when the
Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330 coming from Johannesburg disintegrated on landing.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch ministry said on Thursday that 70 Dutch nationals were among the dead,
while a diplomat said relatives from the Netherlands have been flown to Libya
courtesy of Afriqiyah to identify the bodies and prepare their repatriation.
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement added that "the family of the nine-year-old Ruben, the sole
survivor of the disaster," were among those who perished.
</P>
<P>
Johannesburg private Talk Radio 702 reported on Thursday that at least 10 South
Africans died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian foreign ministry said two of its nationals died, one of them a
resident of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Zidan said the rest of the dead included passengers from Britain, France,
Finland, Germany, the Philippines and Zimbabwe, although he could not give a
breakdown of their numbers. It was unclear how many were dual nationals.
</P>
<P>
With the plane's black boxes recovered, investigators from manufacturers Airbus
and France, where the plane was built, have also flown to join the inquiry led
by Libya, which has ruled out terrorism as the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses spoke of the aircraft inexplicably breaking up as it came in to land
in clear weather.
</P>
<P>
"It is too soon to know the causes of the accident," Sabri Shadi, the chairman
of the board of Afriqiyah Airways, said about the probe.
</P>
<P>
"Several committees have been set up to investigate and we need some time before
we can draw any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
"A preliminary report should be published in the next few days but definitive
results will not be known for several days, even weeks."
</P>
<P>
Shadi was speaking after a first meeting of the team, which US investigators
were to join on Friday.

Sole Libyan crash survivor loses parents, brother: report

<TEXT>
<P>
A nine-year-old Dutch boy, sole survivor of the Tripoli plane crash that killed
103 people, lost his parents and brother in an horrific end to a dream African
safari, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The boy, identified by the foreign ministry only as Ruben, was visited a day
after the crash by an aunt and uncle flown into Tripoli by the Dutch government,
and smiled when he saw them, said the foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
"He was of course after the disaster he experienced, after the great loss of his
parents and brother, happy to see two familiar faces at his bedside," Foreign
Minister Maxime Verhagen told journalists.
</P>
<P>
"His condition is stable but it is not yet possible to transport him."
</P>
<P>
The ministry refused to reveal the surname of the boy, who hails from the
southern city of Tilburg, to protect the family's privacy, but a regional daily
newspaper said he was probably Ruben van Assouw.
</P>
<P>
The Brabants Daily quoted his grandmother An van de Sande as saying the boy had
been on a South African safari with his brother Enzo, 11, mother Trudy, 41, and
father Patrick, 40, to celebrate the couple's copper wedding anniversary --
marked in the Netherlands after 12.5 years.
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand. It's like we're in a film," Van de Sande said.
</P>
<P>
Verhagen confirmed that the survivor's father, mother and 11-year-old brother
were among 70 Dutch citizens who perished when an Afriqiyah Airways plane from
Johannesburg disintegrated on landing around 6:00 am (0400 GMT) at Tripoli
airport on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch tour operators federation, ANWB, said it had sent a team to Tripoli
from Brussels on Thursday that included a trauma psychologist and an intensive
care nurse to assess the boy's condition and bring him home.
</P>
<P>
"Their task is to assess the boy's psychological and physical condition, to see
how he can be brought back to the Netherlands, and when," spokesman Ad Vonk told
AFP.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the boy's doctor said he had come round after surgery for his smashed
legs and was in a stable condition but confused.
</P>
<P>
"The child underwent several rounds of surgery to his legs. He had simple
fractures and double fractures," the doctor said on Libyan state television,
which also showed pictures of the boy's legs in casts.
</P>
<P>
"He woke up (late Wednesday night) and is in good condition," the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, forensic experts and consular staff arrived in Tripoli on Thursday
morning to help identify the dead and provide support on the ground, said
foreign ministry spokesman Francesco Mascini.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Safety Board, an autonomous body, said it had sent two investigators
to "observe" the Libyan investigation into the crash.
</P>
<P>
"They may do no independent investigation", a statement said, but were allowed
under international regulations to visit the crash site and have access to all
the evidence.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende and Verhagen met next-of-kin of the 70
victims on Thursday afternoon, in what the minister later described as a "an
emotional meeting".
</P>
<P>
He urged all relatives to stay in the Netherlands "because they are needed to
help gather information required for identification purposes", including
providing DNA material.

Libya plane crash boy survivor stable but confused: doctor

tripoli, May 13, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Dutch boy who miraculously survived a Libyan plane crash that killed 103
people including his parents is confused but stable, a doctor said Thursday, as
relatives arrived in Tripoli to comfort him.
</P>
<P>
The boy, identified only as "Ruben" by the Dutch foreign ministry but more fully
named by the Dutch media as nine-year-old Ruben van Assouw, has come round after
surgery to his smashed legs, the doctor treating him in a Tripoli hospital said.
</P>
<P>
"He woke up (late Wednesday night) and is in good condition," the doctor said,
while stressing that the boy was confused and "still is not reacting well to his
surroundings."
</P>
<P>
"The child underwent several rounds of surgery to his legs. He had simple
fractures and double fractures," the doctor said on Libyan state television,
which also showed pictures of the boy's legs in casts.
</P>
<P>
A Dutch foreign ministry spokesman said an uncle and an aunt arrived in Tripoli
Thursday on a Netherlands government plane and were taken to the hospital "to
make sure that Ruben will see family faces next to his bed."
</P>
<P>
The boy would be flown back home "as soon as his medical condition allows," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Christoph Prommersberger told AFP that the boy was doing
"reasonably well."
</P>
<P>
"A colleague from the embassy (in Tripoli) was able to speak with him. He told
her he was Ruben, nine years old, from the city of Tilburg," Prommersberger
said. "He is not in a critical condition."
</P>
<P>
Dutch newspaper Babants Dagblad said the boy was likely Ruben van Assouw from
Tilburg in the southern Netherlands who had been on safari in South Africa with
his mother Trudy, 41, father Patrick, 40, and his brother Enzo, 11.
</P>
<P>
Also on board the Dutch government plane to Tripoli were forensic experts,
consular staff and transport ministry staff, the foreign ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Libya's Transport Minister Mohammed Ali Zidan said a total of 103 people -- 92
passengers of nine nationalities and an 11-strong Libyan crew -- died when an
Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330 coming from Johannesburg disintegrated on landing
at Tripoli airport.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch foreign ministry said on Thursday that 70 Dutch nationals were among
the dead, while a diplomat said family members from the Netherlands have been
flown in to Libya courtesy of Afriqiyah to identify the bodies and prepare their
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Johannesburg private Talk Radio 702 reported on Thursday that at least 10 South
Africans died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
Libya's transport minister said the rest of the dead included two Germans as
well as passengers from Britain, France, Finland, the Philippines and Zimbabwe,
although he could not give a breakdown of their numbers.
</P>
<P>
With the plane's black boxes recovered, investigators from manufacturers Airbus
and France where the plane was built have also flown to join the inquiry led by
Libya, which has ruled out terrorism as the cause of Wednesday's crash.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses spoke of the aircraft inexplicably breaking up as it came in to land
in clear weather.
</P>
<P>
"It is too soon to know the causes of the accident," Sabri Shadi, the chairman
of the board of Afriqiyah Airways, said about the probe into the crash.
</P>
<P>

Shadi said that after a first meeting which grouped the team that US

been placed under police guard.
</P>
<P>
Libyan authorities said they were prepared to offer all assistance, granting
full access to its airport operations.

Sole survivor 'probably' nine-year-old Dutch boy: media
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
The Hague, May 13, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sole survivor of a Libyan plane crash that killed 103 people may be nine-
year-old Ruben van Assouw from Tilburg in the southern Netherlands, a local
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We received a telephone call" from officials to say that the boy, being treated
in a Libyan hospital, mentioned the name "Ruben", his grandmother An van de
Sande told the Brabants Dagblad as the foreign ministry confirmed that two
presumed family members of the injured child were on their way to Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Ruben had been on safari in South Africa with his brother Enzo, 11, mother
Trudy, 41, and father Patrick, 40, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one Dutch citizens were believed killed when an Afriqiyah Airways plane
coming from Johannesburg disintegrated on landing around 6:00 am (0400 GMT) at
Tripoli airport on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Van de Sande said she and other family members had waited for news at a Brussels
air field the whole of Wednesday, "and so I haven't yet seen the television
footage" of the bruised boy in his hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
"Other family members have seen it, but it is difficult to be 100 percent sure
that it is indeed Ruben.
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand it. It's like we're in a movie."
</P>
<P>
Dutch officials said Wednesday the child had undergone surgery for broken bones
and his condition was not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokesman Francesco Mascini would on Thursday not confirm the
survivor's identity "until the two presumed family members have seen the child".
</P>
<P>
Mascini said the two family members had left on a government plane around 6:00
am (0400 GMT) from the port city of Rotterdam, and would make their way to the
hospital on arrival in Tripoli later in the morning.
</P>
<P>
"Until the presumed family members have seen the child, we cannot say anything
about his identity with certainty."
</P>
<P>
Also on board the plane were forensic experts and consular staff to help
identify the dead and provide support on the ground, said Mascini, as well as
experts from the transport ministry to "help determine the cause of the crash".
Dutch tourism federation ANWB said Wednesday that 61 Dutch citizens, part of two
separate tour groups on their way to Brussels and Duesseldorf, Germany died in
the crash, but this figure has not been officially confirmed.

Libya plane crash boy survivor says he's 'fine'

<TEXT>
<P>
The nine-year-old Dutch boy who was the only survivor of a plane crash that
killed 103 people said he is in a lot of pain but keen to go home, in his first
comments published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ruben van Assouw could remember nothing of Wednesday's disaster and was not yet
aware that his parents and 11-year-old brother had died in the accident, the
Dutch newspaper Telegraaf reported.
</P>
<P>
"My name is Ruben and I am from Holland," Telegraaf reported on a telephone
conversation with the sole survivor of the Afriqiyah Airways crash at Tripoli
airport.
</P>
<P>
"I am fine, but my legs hurt a lot," the boy told a reporter from the newspaper
on the mobile phone of one of his doctors.
</P>
<P>
"I am in a hospital," Ruben told the newspaper. "There are men and women here. I
don't know how I got here, I don't know anything more," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I really want to go home."
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi's eldest son, Seif al-Islam, visited the boy on
Thursday at the hospital in the capital where he is recovering after surgery on
his smashed legs, the official Jana news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Islam had "asked about the health of the Dutch boy and about the treatment he is
receiving from doctors at Al-Khadra hospital," the Libyan news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The boy and his family had been returning from a safari holiday in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He has only been identified by the Dutch foreign ministry as Ruben but more
fully by Dutch media as Ruben van Assouw.
</P>
<P>
He greeted an aunt and uncle with a smile when they arrived at his Tripoli
bedside on Thursday and would be transported to the Netherlands as soon as his
medical condition allowed, a doctor said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said 70 Dutch citizens, including Ruben's family, were among the 103
people killed when the Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330 from Johannesburg
disintegrated on landing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch newspaper Brabants Dagblad said the boy was probably from Tilburg in
the southern Netherlands and that he had been on safari in South Africa with his
mother Trudy, 41, father Patrick, 40, and brother Enzo, 11.
</P>
<P>
Siddiq ben Dilla, the doctor who operated on the boy, said on Thursday that he
was "getting better" and could return to the Netherlands in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
"His family is with him now," the doctor told AFP. "His memory is good: as soon
as his relatives walked in he smiled, and was happy to see them."

Haiti prosecutors seek prison for US missionary
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PORT-AU-PRINCE, May 13, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors asked Thursday for a six-month prison term for US missionary Laura
Silsby, who was arrested trying to leave Haiti with 33 children following the
devastating January earthquake that hit the country.
</P>
<P>
Silsby was described as the leader of a group of 10 US Baptists stopped at the
border with the Dominican Republic with the children who were purported to be
orphans.
</P>
<P>
Although she was initially accused of child abduction, the charges were later
revised to "irregular travel."
</P>
<P>
A verdict in the case is expected within a few days, judicial officials said.
</P>
<P>
Silsby and her fellow Baptist missionaries were arrested on January 29 as they
tried to take the children into the neighboring Dominican Republic by bus
without the necessary documentation.
</P>
<P>
The members of the New Life Children's Refuge missionary group denied
wrongdoing, saying they were only trying to help orphans in the wake of Haiti's
devastating January 12 earthquake that killed more than 250,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Haitian authorities later determined that all 33 children that the US
missionaries tried to remove from the country had parents, with whom they were
eventually reunited.
</P>
<P>
Silsby's defense lawyer Jean Renel Tessier argued that Silsby should not be
convicted on the charges "because the border with the Dominican Republic was
open."
</P>
<P>
The other nine missionaries arrested were all released and allowed to return to
the United States, but Silsby, the leader of the group, remained detained in
Port-au-Prince.

<TEXT>
<P>
Nine-year-old Ruben van Assouw, the sole survivor of a Libyan airliner crash,
arrived back home in the Netherlands on Saturday, three days after the disaster
that killed his parents, brother and 100 others, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"The plane with the surviving boy has landed" at the Eindhoven military air
base, spokesman Markus van Tol of the Dutch tourism federation ANWB told AFP, as
reports said Ruben was then transferred to an ambulance with blacked out windows
and taken to an undisclosed hospital.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by an uncle and aunt and the Libyan doctor who had been treating
him, the air ambulance transporting the boy landed around 2:15 pm (1215 GMT),
according to Dutch news agency ANP.
</P>
<P>
The flight had left from Matiga military airfield in the Libyan capital about
three hours earlier, with every effort being made to hide the boy from the sight
of journalists, photographers and onlookers on both ends.
</P>
<P>
"He's a very special patient. He is talking and in good health. I will stay (in
the Netherlands) for as long as necessary," Dr Siddiq ben Dilla told AFP before
the Cessna Citation air ambulance took off from Libya.
</P>
<P>
Police prevented photographers from approaching as Ruben was taken from hospital
by stretcher, covered in a blue blanket and with a black cap on his head and
scarf covering his face, to the ambulance for the journey to the airport.
</P>
<P>
Upon landing, the boy identified by the foreign ministry only as Ruben from
Tilburg in the southern Netherlands and more fully as Ruben van Assouw by Dutch
media, was taken by ambulance with two doctors and a nurse to hospital.
</P>
<P>
About an hour after landing at Eindhoven, the foreign ministry said "Ruben has
arrived safely at his final destination", which it declined to specify.
</P>
<P>
"This concludes the news about Ruben," foreign ministry spokesman Christoph
Prommersberger told AFP. "There won't be any more information, any more
updates."
</P>
<P>
The Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330 flight from Johannesburg in South Africa
disintegrated on landing. Officials said 70 Dutch citizens were among the 103
people killed, although Afriqiyah Airways said there were 67 Dutch on board,
including Ruben.
</P>
<P>
The boy was found alive, strapped into his seat at the accident site.
</P>
<P>
A commission of inquiry said Saturday that the plane did not catch fire before
hitting the ground.
</P>
<P>
"We have not found debris detached from the plane or evidence of fire before the
accident," commission chief Neji Dhaou was quoted as saying by official news
agency JANA.
</P>
<P>
"The fire broke out 400 metres (yards) from the initial impact with the ground."
</P>
<P>
Ruben himself has told a Dutch newspaper he could remember nothing about the
crash.
</P>
<P>
"I am fine, but my legs hurt a lot," he said in a telephone interview published
Friday, adding: "I really want to go home."
</P>
<P>
Ruben's aunt and uncle said on Friday the boy was now aware that his mother,
father and 11-year-old brother died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
"We have explained to Ruben exactly what happened. He knows that his parents and
his brother are dead," they said in a statement read to media in Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
"The time ahead will be a difficult period for us," the statement said. "We hope
that the media will respect our privacy."

Gross worked for an NGO contracted by the State Department to supply computer

Saga of sex, blood and football grips Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
RIO DE JANEIRO, July 9, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It takes quite a saga to push the World Cup off the front pages in Brazil, but
such is the gruesome story of a goalkeeper accused of ordering the murder of his
ex-lover whose body parts were then fed to the dogs.
</P>
<P>
At the center of the dark drama is Bruno Souza, a star goalkeeper and captain of
defending club champion Flamengo, who surrendered to police Wednesday to face
questioning in connection with the disappearance and suspected death of Eliza
Samudio.
</P>
<P>
The story of the married 25-year-old player known simply as Bruno has stunned
this football-mad nation, where police held a press conference Thursday to lay
out the horrific crimes and Souza's bloody role in them.
</P>
<P>
"An idol like Bruno, from such a major team, is a monster for what he has done
to this girl," said Minas Gerais state police commissioner Edson Moreira, one of
the officials leading the investigation.
</P>
<P>
"The crime was coldly planned and executed. We can conclude that Eliza is dead."
</P>
<P>
Among the macabre details divulged by police: they believe Bruno was in a home
near Belo Horizonte home with Samudio last month at the time of her murder, and
that her body was later cut into pieces, some of which were fed to dogs in a bid
to cover the murder.
</P>
<P>
When Bruno was transferred from Rio de Janeiro to a police station late Thursday
in the city of Belo Horizonte, he was met with cries of "murderer!" from a crowd
of onlookers, O Globo reported on its website.
</P>
<P>
Samudio was described by the newspaper as "a student, model and pornographic
film actress."
</P>
<P>
She was also the mother of a four-month-old baby and reportedly had sought to
establish that Bruno was the child's father.
</P>
<P>
Samudio's body has not been found, but Bruno's 17-year-old cousin, who
acknowledged helping in her abduction, claimed in a lengthy deposition to police
that the woman was strangled, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The cousin also claimed to have heard Bruno tell associates to "solve the
problem" with Samudio.
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, she was strangled by a former police officer, Marcos
Aparecido dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
Another one of Bruno's cousins said in his deposition that Santos committed
"barbaric tortures" against Samudio, and that music was blared from her locked
room so that neighbors could not hear her screams, according to the Estado de
Sao Paulo newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The victim had begged Santos to stop abusing her, saying she could no longer
bear it, according to O Estado, citing the deposition.
</P>
<P>
"You are not going to bear it anymore," Santos replied. "You are going to die."
</P>
<P>
Both papers reported that Santos fed some of her remains to the Rottweiler dogs
kept at the house.
</P>
<P>
Samudio met Bruno in 2009 at the home of a Flamengo teammate, according to Istoe
magazine. In October, when she was five months pregnant, she reportedly filed a
complaint against Bruno, saying he kidnapped and beat her and tried to force her
to swallow abortion-inducing medication.
</P>
<P>
In June, Samudio met Bruno near Belo Horizonte, apparently thinking the two were
going to reach an agreement for care of the baby. It was June 7, the last time a
friend saw her alive.
</P>
<P>
Moreira said Thursday that police determined from the evidence that Bruno
remained with Samudio until her death.
</P>
<P>
"He was with her. This is the conclusion we reached," he said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they ordered the detention of Bruno's wife, Dayana Rodrigues,
who was found with Samudio's baby.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bruno recently told radio Globo that he had a "clear conscience"
about Samudio's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, I'll laugh about all of this," he said.
</P>
<P>
But in a brief Globo video clip of him discussing his future with police, he
sounded somber about his future.
</P>
<P>
"In Brazil, my hope to compete in the World Cup in 2014 is over," he said.

<P>
The court convicted Wang, Tao and another 28 members of the criminal gang on
charges of organising prostitution, false imprisonment, bribery and rape.
</P>
<P>
The report did not provide details on the other sentences.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is female, and Tao used the front companies to hide their illegal
earnings, which exceeded 100 million yuan (14.7 million dollars), the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of women were forced to work as prostitutes, it said.
</P>
<P>
The gang bribed a number of government officials to protect their illegal
racket, including Chen Tao, a former senior police official who has been jailed
for corruption.
</P>
<P>
Chen was an associate of Wen Qiang, the former head of Chongqing's judiciary and
an ex-deputy police chief who was executed last month for charges including rape
and taking bribes to protect gangs.
</P>
<P>
Wen's death brought to a climax a crime crackdown that lifted the lid on the
seamy underworld in Chongqing and has resulted in more than 3,300 detentions and
hundreds of prosecutions.

No talk of US-Cuba prisoner swap: US senator
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON, Oct 6, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A top US senator just back from a five-day visit to Cuba to meet with officials
there said Wednesday he did not believe there was any chance of a prisoner swap
between the United States and its communist neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Senate Banking Committee chairman Christopher Dodd made the trip for talks with
officials in Havana on how to improve relations between the former Cold War
foes, his office said. The countries do not have full diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Dodd, who also chairs the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on the Western
Hemisphere, has been a frequent vocal critic of the US trade embargo on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In December, Cuba detained a US government contractor, Alan Gross, whom Havana
accused of distributing communications materials to civil groups.
</P>
<P>
The United States, meanwhile, since 2001 has jailed five Cuban spies for Havana.
</P>
<P>
Though US media have speculated on the possibility of a swap, Dodd said it was
not being discussed before he left for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
And he stressed that in his view, Gross' case was very different from that of
the Cubans, who were spying on US military installations. He also said that he
was not able to meet with Gross during the visit.
</P>
<P>
But in Havana, Cuban President Raul Castro urged his US counterpart, Barack
Obama, to free the five Cuban spies. Cuba maintains the spies were protecting it
from terrorism that could come from the United States, an argument that is not
likely to be an easy sell in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Castro, 79, also slammed Washington for "arbitrarily" continuing to claim that
Havana is a state sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Obama "has failed to acknowledge the cooperation that he has received from Cuba"
in fighting terrorism, Castro said, while individuals who have committed attacks
on Cuban targets -- Luis Posada Carriles and Orlando Bosch -- are living quietly
and without being punished, in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Dodd earlier this year announced he would not seek reelection, was a lead author
of legislation to lift the effective ban on travel by US citizens to Cuba. The
measure is stalled in the US Senate. Dodd is a Democrat who represents
Connecticut.

Christian woman sentenced to death in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LAHORE, Pakistan, Nov 11, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pakistani court has sentenced to death a Christian mother of five for
blasphemy, the first such conviction of a woman and sparking protests from
rights groups Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Asia Bibi, 45, was sentenced Monday by a local court in Nankana district in
Pakistan's central province Punjab, about 75 kilometres (47 miles) west of the
country's cultural capital of Lahore.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has yet to execute anyone for blasphemy, but the case spotlights the
Muslim country's controversial laws on the subject which rights activists say
encourages Islamist extremism in a nation wracked by Taliban attacks.
</P>
<P>
Asia's case dates back to June 2009 when she was asked to fetch water while out
working in the fields. But a group of Muslim women labourers objected, saying
that as a non-Muslim, she should not touch the water bowl.
</P>
<P>
A few days later the women went to a local cleric and alleged that Asia made
made derogatory remarks about the Prophet Mohammed. The cleric went to local
police, who opened an investigation.
</P>
<P>
She was arrested in Ittanwalai village and prosecuted under Section 295 C of the
Pakistan Penal Code, which carries the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Sentencing her to hang, Judge Naveed Iqbal "totally ruled out" any chance that
Asia was falsely implicated and said there were "no mitigating circumstances",
according to a copy of the verdict seen by AFP.
</P>
<P>
Husband Ashiq Masih, 51, told AFP that he would appeal her death sentence, which
needs to be upheld by the Lahore high court, the highest tribunal in Punjab,
before it can be carried out.
</P>
<P>
"The case is baseless and we will file an appeal," he said.
</P>
<P>
The couple have two sons and three daughters.
</P>
<P>
Rights activists and minority pressure groups said it was the first time that a
woman had been sentenced to hang in Pakistan for blasphemy, although a Muslim
couple were jailed for life last year.
</P>
<P>
Human rights activists want the controversial legislation repealed, saying it is
exploited for personal enmity and encourages Islamist extremism.
</P>
<P>
"The blasphemy law is absolutely obscene and it needs to be repealed in
totality," Human Rights Watch spokesman Ali Dayan Hasan told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"It is primarily used against vulnerable groups that face social and political
discrimination. Heading that category are religious minorities and heterodox
Muslim sects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Asia's case at a press conference in Islamabad on Thursday, visiting
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said he was unaware of the details but
would raise the matter with Pakistan's minorities minister.
</P>
<P>
"The Italian position has always been against the death penalty," he told
reporters. He said he raised the problems faced by Christian minorities during
his talks with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi.
</P>
<P>
"I believe they should not misuse the law of blasphemy to discriminate against
religious minorities and this is a point I share with my colleague -- this is a
key point for me."
</P>
<P>
Around three percent of Pakistan's population of 167 million is estimated to be
non-Muslim.
</P>
<P>
Last July, two Christian brothers accused of writing a blasphemous pamphlet
critical of the Prophet Mohammed were shot dead outside a court in Punjab.
</P>
<P>
Pastor Rashid Emmanuel, 32, and his brother Sajjad, were killed as they left a
court hearing in Faisalabad city, where hundreds of Muslim protesters had
demanded they be sentenced to death.

<P>
A top Pakistan government official Saturday backed a Christian mother's appeal
against a death sentence for blasphemy, saying he hoped President Asif Ali
Zardari would pardon her.
</P>
<P>
Asia Bibi was sentenced to hang in Pakistan's central province of Punjab earlier
this month after being accused of insulting the Prophet Mohammed in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Punjab governor Salman Taseer met Bibi in prison and told a televised press
conference afterwards that he would personally pass on her request for clemency.
</P>
<P>
"I will soon meet President Asif Ali Zardari and hand him over Bibi's appeal,"
he said. "I hope that the president will pardon her."
</P>
<P>
The contents of the appeal were not immediately known, but Taseer said he was
supporting it on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has yet to execute anyone for blasphemy, but the case spotlights a
controversial law which rights activists say encourages Islamist extremism in a
Muslim country on the front line of the US-led war on Al-Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
Pope Benedict XVI this week called for Bibi's release and said Christians in
Pakistan were "often victims of violence and discrimination."
</P>
<P>
Minister for minority affairs Shahbaz Bhatti earlier this week asked the Punjab
government for a thorough re-investigation and a fair appeal hearing for the
mother of five.
</P>
<P>
At the Lahore high court, the top court in Punjab, Bibi has filed a separate
appeal against her conviction.
</P>
<P>
Her lawyer S.K. Chaudhry said the court would take up the case next week.
</P>

In June 2009, Bibi was asked to fetch water while out working in the fields. But

Pakistan minister seeks pardon for blasphemy death Christian

ISLAMABAD, Nov 25, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pakistani cabinet minister Thursday presented a report to President Asif Ali
Zardari recommending a pardon for a Christian mother of five sentenced to death
for blasphemy against Islam.
</P>
<P>
Asia Bibi was sentenced to hang in Pakistan's central province of Punjab earlier
this month after being found guilty of insulting the Prophet Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Rights activists say Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law, under which the
offence is punishable by death, encourages Islamist extremism in a Muslim
country on the front line of the US-led war on Al-Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
"The report recommended pardon for Asia Bibi and suspension of the sentence," a
government statement said after minority affairs minister Shahbaz Bhatti
presented the document to President Zardari at a meeting in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
It said the report "concluded that the blasphemy case against Asia Bibi has been
registered on grounds of personal enmity".
</P>
<P>
The document recommended providing security both to Bibi in prison and to her
family, who say they have gone into hiding because of death threats.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting Bhatti, who himself is a Christian and was commissioned by
Zardari to investigate the case, said the minority community "has great respect
for all the Holy Prophets and the Holy Books," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The people belonging to minorities as a marginalised community know fully well
the consequences of blasphemy and could never think of committing the offence,"
it quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president asked Bhatti to draw up a committee to propose reforms to the
blasphemy law to "effectively prevent the misuse of (it) for personal and
political reasons," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Pope Benedict XVI last week called for Bibi's release and said Christians in
Pakistan were "often victims of violence and discrimination."
</P>
<P>
Punjab governor Salman Taseer on Sunday was the first senior government official
to appeal to Zardari for clemency after visiting Bibi in prison.

The case began in June 2009 when Bibi was asked to fetch water while out working

Italian court upholds Ivorian's sentence in sex murder
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Rome, Dec 16, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italy's highest appeals court on Thursday confirmed a sentence of 16 years for
an Ivorian man convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering a British student
in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Rudy Guede was was tried separately from American Amanda Knox and Italian
Raffaele Sollecito, who have also been convicted of the murder and are both
currently appealing in a trial in the town of Perugia.
</P>
<P>
"Meredith Kercher's family is satisfied by this decision," Francesco Maresca, a
lawyer for the family, said after the ruling.
</P>
<P>
He said there should now be "an identical solution" for Knox and Sollecito.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old victim, Meredith Kercher, was in Perugia as an exchange student
from Leeds University and shared a cottage with Seattle native Knox.
</P>
<P>
Kercher was found semi-naked in a pool of blood on November 2, 2007.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said she was assaulted and killed by Guede, Sollecito and Knox as
part of a drug-fuelled sex orgy. Knox is currently serving a 26-year sentence
for the crime and Sollecito was handed a 25-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
Sollecito and Knox say they are innocent. Guede has claimed he was in the house
at the time of the murder but had no part in it.
</P>
<P>
Guede was convicted during a fast-track trial in 2008 but then had his sentence
reduced from 30 years to 16 years in December 2009 on appeal.
</P>
<P>
The appeal court said then it had reduced the sentence because of Guede's young
age of just 20 at the time of the killing, his "difficult life" and the fact
that he was the only one who had apologised to Kercher's family.

I. Coast UN envoy warns of 'genocide' threat
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
UNITED NATIONS, Dec 29, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first recognized ambassador of Ivory Coast's internationally-backed
president Alassane Ouattara said Tuesday that the United Nations had to act to
prevent "genocide" in his country.
</P>
<P>
The envoy, Youssoufou Bamba, made the plea after handing over his credentials as
envoy to the United Nations to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.
</P>
<P>
Ban promised the "full cooperation" of the UN leadership for the government of
Ouattara who is in a tense standoff with Laurent Gbagbo, who refuses to
recognize the victory of his rival in Ivory Coast's November 28 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Ouattara had "real concern" about attacks on his supporters.
According to UN rights officials at least 173 people were killed in attacks
between December 16 and 21.
</P>
<P>
The victims were only killed "because they wanted to demonstrate, they want to
speak out, they want to defend the will of the people," Bamba told reporters.
"We are on the brink of genocide, something should be done."
</P>
<P>
Bamba said people's homes in some areas had been marked according to their
tribe. "What will be next? So the situation is very serious and I have put that
message across in all the meetings I have had, including with the secretary
general."
</P>
<P>
"The protection of civilians is at the heart of peacekeeping and we expect the
United Nations to fulfill its duties," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is a UN force of more than 9,500 troops in Ivory Coast and 800 are
deployed around the Abidjan hotel where Ouattara has his base.
</P>
<P>
Ban made no comment on the Ivory Coast crisis when he formally accepted Bamba's
credentials in front of photographers at the UN headquarters.
</P>
<P>
But he assured the envoy "of the full cooperation of the secretariat in meeting
the challenges ahead."
</P>
<P>
Ban was briefed again Tuesday by the UN mission in Ivory Coast on efforts to
persuade Gbagbo to peacefully stand down, his spokesman Martin Nesirky said.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief also held telephone talks with Nigeria's President Goodluck
Jonathan, current chairman of the West African regional bloc ECOWAS, which has
threatened to intervene militarily if Gbagbo does not quit.
</P>
<P>
Bamba, who was previously ambassador for the Gbagbo government at the UN in
Vienna, is the first ambassador named by the Ouattara administration to have
started work. He hinted that he was not yet being paid, saying that as a career
diplomat "I have savings."

American to take the stand in Italy murder trial

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An American accused in the 2007 killing of a British student in Italy is expected to defend herself from charges of murder and sexual assault when she takes the stand Friday.
</P>
<P>
Amanda Knox, an exchange student from Seattle, is on trial in the central Italian town of Perugia for the death of her roommate and fellow student, the 21-year-old Meredith Kercher.
</P>
<P>
Knox and co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito, her former Italian boyfriend, have always denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
"She's a bit nervous about going on to the stand, but she's also quite confident in what she has to say and that the truth will come out during her testimony," the American's father, Kurt Knox, told CBS' "Early Show" on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"She is going to be telling the truth and answering all of the questions, and hopefully the court will see that and see that she had nothing to do with this and that she's 100 percent innocent," Knox said, speaking from Perugia.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the testimony his daughter would be speaking Italian, which she mostly learned during the year and a half she has spent in jail.
</P>
<P>
Kercher was found in a pool of blood in the apartment she shared with Knox on Nov. 2, 2007. Prosecutors allege the defendants strangled and stabbed her neck and say the Briton was killed during what began as a sex game.
</P>
<P>
Kercher's wounds were compatible with a kitchen knife the prosecution says might have been the murder weapon. The knife was found at Sollecito's house and prosecutors say Knox's DNA was found on the handle and Kercher's was found on the blade.
</P>
<P>
Knox and Sollecito, jailed since shortly after the slaying, have given conflicting statements over their whereabouts the night of the murder.
</P>
<P>
Knox initially said she was at home and implicated the Congolese owner of a bar where she worked. The man was cleared after being detained for two weeks, and Knox has since insisted she was not at home during the slaying.
</P>
<P>
Sollecito has said he was at his own apartment in Perugia, working at his computer. He said he does not remember if Knox spent the whole night with him or just part of it.
</P>
<P>
The two risk Italy's stiffest punishment, life imprisonment, if convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
A third suspect in the case, Ivory Coast national Rudy Hermann Guede, was found guilty of murder and sexual violence and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He was given a fast-track trial at his request, and his appeal is set to start in November. He too denies wrongdoing.

Seattle student: I wasn ' t present at Italy killing

<TEXT>
<P>
An American student accused of murdering her British roommate took the stand for the first time Friday, telling an Italian court in a quavering voice that she saw the victim hours before the killing, then went to her boyfriend's house for the night.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say 21-year-old Meredith Kercher was killed after returning home from an outing with friends on the evening of Nov. 1, 2007. They say she opened the door for her roommate, 21-year-old Amanda Knox of Seattle, and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito.
</P>
<P>
Sometime later that night, prosecutors say, Kercher was killed in what began as a sex game, with Sollecito holding her by the shoulders from behind while Knox touched her with the point of a knife.
</P>
<P>
Kercher's body was found the next day in a pool of blood in the apartment she shared with Knox in Perugia, central Italy.
</P>
<P>
Alternating between English and Italian, Knox told the court that she last saw Kercher on the afternoon of Nov. 1. They talked about what they had done the night before -- a Halloween night out -- and Knox said Kercher still had a bit of her vampire makeup on.
</P>
<P>
Sollecito then arrived at the apartment and he and Knox had something to eat while Kercher was in her room, Knox told the court.
</P>
<P>
"She left her room, said 'bye,' walked out the door," Knox said, at this point speaking Italian. "That was the last time I saw her."
</P>
<P>
She told the court that she and Sollecito had gone to Sollecito's house, where they stayed until the next morning.
</P>
<P>
"I told Raffaele that I wanted to watch a movie so we went to his place," Knox said. After dinner, they went upstairs to his room, she said.
</P>
<P>
"I sat on the bed, he sat at his desk, he prepared the joint and then we smoked it together," she said. "First we made love, then we fell asleep."
</P>
<P>
Knox and Sollecito have been jailed since shortly after the slaying. They are both charged with murder and sexual violence.
</P>
<P>
They could face Italy's stiffest punishment, life imprisonment, if convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
Knox occasionally paused to take a breath and had a blemish on her upper lip, which her family said was a cold sore caused by stress. However, during most of her testimony she appeared calm and confident.
</P>
<P>
Sollecito, 25, has said he was at his own apartment the entire night of Nov. 1, mainly working at his computer. He said he does not remember if Knox spent the whole night with him or just part of it. The two have said they could not remember events clearly because they had taken drugs.
</P>
<P>
Knox also repeated accusations that she was beaten by police and confused when she was questioned in the days after the killing. Police have denied any misconduct.
</P>
<P>
After the killing, Knox accused Diya "Patrick" Lumumba, a Congolese man who owns a pub in Perugia, of being the culprit. Lumumba was jailed briefly in the case, but he is no longer a suspect and is seeking defamation damages from Knox.
</P>
<P>
Knox was called to testify both in her own defense and in a civil case brought by Lumumba.
</P>
<P>
"The declarations were taken against my will, so everything that I said was said in confusion and under pressure," Knox said under questioning by Lumumba's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
"They called me a stupid liar; said I was trying to protect someone. I was not trying to protect anyone," she said. "I didn't know what to respond. They said I left Raffaele's home, which I denied, but they continued to call me 'stupid liar.'"
</P>
<P>
Knox smiled as she walked into the court before her testimony. She was dressed in a white shirt and white trousers and had her hair pulled into a ponytail.
</P>
<P>
Knox's father, Curt Knox, said his daughter looked "confident in what she wants to say."
</P>
<P>
"She has nothing to hide," he told The Associated Press during a break. He said he hoped people could now see a "different Amanda," -- different from the way she has been portrayed by the media so far.
</P>
<P>
The trial began in January and a verdict is expected after a summer break.
</P>
<P>
A third suspect in the case, Ivory Coast national Rudy Hermann Guede, was found guilty of murder and sexual violence and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He was given a fast-track trial at his request, and his appeal is set to start in November. He, too, denies wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
The trial has been closed to cameras but the presiding judge, exceptionally, allowed them in to film for Knox's testimony -- only to ask them to leave a few minutes later for causing too much disruption. The cameras were then crammed in the press room, where proceedings were being shown on a screen.

PERUGIA, Italy -- An American student who denies murdering her British roommate testified that she was shocked by the death of a woman she considered her friend, and said a "crescendo" of police pressure led her to accuse an innocent man.
</P>
<P>
Amanda Knox of Seattle had already told the court on Friday that she was not in the apartment she shared with Meredith Kercher on the night in 2007 when the British woman was slain.
</P>
<P>
Knox, 21, and Italian co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito, her ex-boyfriend, are accused of murder and sexual violence in the slaying of Kercher, who was found in a pool of blood Nov. 2, 2007 in the shared apartment in this central Italian town.
</P>
<P>
Knox took the stand for the first time Friday and said she spent the night of the killing at Sollecito's apartment. Prosecutors believe Knox, Sollecito and a third suspect convicted in a separate trial went to Kercher's home the night of the murder and killed the British woman in what began as a sex game.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Knox repeated accusations that she was beaten by police and confused when she was questioned in the days after the killing. Police have denied any misconduct.
</P>
<P>
She said it was the pressure that led her to accuse Diya "Patrick" Lumumba, a Congolese man who owns a pub in Perugia, of the killing. Lumumba was jailed briefly but was later cleared and is seeking defamation damages from Knox.
</P>
<P>
Police have denied any improper behavior, but Knox repeated her claim Saturday when questioned by lead prosecutor Giuliano Mignini.
</P>
<P>
"It was always a crescendo," she said recalling her early questioning sessions. "When I said I was with Raffaele all the time they told me I was a liar. I was scared, I thought: maybe they are right."
</P>
<P>
Knox said that interrogators "wanted a name" and that a policewoman hit her twice on the head.
</P>
<P>
"Do you remember? Do you remember? And then boom! On the head," Knox said, mimicking the slap in court. "I went: mamma mia! And then again, another boom!"
</P>
<P>
She said it was that pressure that made her come up with Lumumba's name and her initial story that she was at home during the murder and covered her ears against the victim's screams.
</P>
<P>
"It didn't hurt, but it frightened me," she said of the slaps.
</P>
<P>
When asked if she had suffered after Kercher's death, Knox said: "Yes. I was very shocked, I couldn't imagine something like that."
</P>
<P>
She said she considered Kercher "a friend." This contrasted with previous testimony by other witnesses that Kercher had complained about Knox's bathroom habits and had expressed surprise at her apparent promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
Knox said she felt sorrow over her roommate's death.
</P>
<P>
"I am very sorry for what happened, sometimes it seems to me it cannot be real," she said.
</P>
<P>
Knox answered questions confidently and in a steady voice for about five hours, sitting at the witness stand with a prison guard behind her. Though she had an interpreter next to her, the American spoke in fluent Italian, which she mostly learned in the year and a half she has spent in jail.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Mignini said he was satisfied with how Knox's testimony went, adding that he did not consider her credible.
</P>
<P>
Kercher family lawyer Francesco Maresca said the American was well prepared. "She answered quite satisfactorily, but didn't bring anything new," he said.
</P>
<P>
Later Saturday, Andrew Seliber, a friend of Knox and a fellow student at the University of Washington, also took the stand, called by the American's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
In Perugia, "she was having the happiest time of her life," Seliber said. "She worked three jobs responsibly so she had the money to come here."
</P>
<P>
Knox appeared moved when Seliber walked into the small, frescoed courtroom and she listened carefully to his testimony.
</P>
<P>
More of Knox's family members and friends are scheduled to take the stand in upcoming sessions. Her mother, Edda Mellas, will testify at the next hearing, Friday.
</P>
<P>
Knox and Sollecito have been jailed since shortly after the slaying. Sollecito, 25, has said he was at his own apartment the entire night of Nov. 1. He said he does not remember if Knox spent the whole night with him or just part of it. The two have said they could not remember events clearly because they had taken drugs.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege Kercher came home after an evening with friends on Nov. 1, and soon after opened the door to Knox, Sollecito and Rudy Hermann Guede, who was convicted of murder last year and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Guede, who denies wrongdoing, was given a fast-track trial at his request.
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecutors, Sollecito held Kercher by the shoulders from behind while Knox touched her with the point of a knife. They say Guede, an Ivory Coast national, tried to sexually assault Kercher and then Knox fatally stabbed her in the throat.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors maintain a kitchen knife found at Sollecito's apartment is compatible with Kercher's wounds, and has the Briton's DNA on the blade and Knox's on the handle.
</P>
<P>
The trial began in January and a verdict is expected after a summer break. Knox and Sollecito could face Italy's stiffest punishment, life imprisonment, if convicted of murder.

Sentencing set for former General Re executive

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge in Connecticut is expected to sentence a former business executive in connection with an accounting scandal at insurer American International Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
John Houldsworth is the former chief executive officer of an Irish affiliate of Berkshire Hathaway's General Re. He has asked the judge for probation and no fines. Houldsworth pleaded guilty to conspiracy to falsify SEC filings.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say AIG paid Stamford, Connecticut-based Gen Re in a secret deal to take out reinsurance policies with AIG in 2000 and 2001, leading to propped up stock prices and inflated reserves that cost AIG shareholders more than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are asking for leniency for Houldsworth because his cooperation helped convict five other executives.

AP: State officials were warned about attack chimp
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW HAVEN, Conn. 2009-06-20 16:07:08 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Connecticut officials were repeatedly warned about the dangers posed by a chimpanzee who later mauled and blinded a woman and were urged -- more than three years before the attack -- to take action, but failed to do so, according to records obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The 200-pound (90-kilogram) chimpanzee named Travis attacked Charla Nash of Stamford in February, ripping off her hands, nose, lips and eyelids. She has been hospitalized for months at the Cleveland Clinic, where her condition late last week was listed as stable.
</P>
<P>
The state's response could affect a high-stakes lawsuit the victim's family filed against the chimp's owner, Sandra Herold of Stamford, seeking $50 million in damages. Attorneys are weighing whether to sue others as well, but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection officials said the agency received general concerns about Travis, but not specific information that the chimpanzee was a public safety threat.
</P>
<P>
Travis, who was shot and killed by police, also had escaped in 2003 from his owner's car and led police on a chase for hours in downtown Stamford. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
Records obtained by The AP through a state open-records request show that the state began receiving warnings immediately after that event.
</P>
<P>
Giselle Bollmann of Stamford sent an e-mail to the DEP on Oct. 21, 2003 citing the escape and calling for a thorough investigation after reading a local newspaper account.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, Linda Howard, who ran a primate rescue operation before she died in 2006, wrote the department, offering recommendations for placing Travis in a sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
State officials were still talking about Travis' 2003 escape two years later and members of at least three state agencies expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
"Due to this incident, persons from the general public contacted the department with safety concerns," the DEP wrote in a report dated Sept. 16, 2005.
</P>
<P>
The draft report by a staff member cited concerns by DEP and two other state agencies about Travis and three other primates in private ownership. The other cases involved small monkeys and a gibbon ape.
</P>
<P>
In a letter released in March, an unidentified DEP biologist warned state officials last October that Travis could seriously hurt someone if he felt threatened, noting that he had reached adult maturity and was very large and strong.
</P>
<P>
The biologist offered several options, including helping the owner place the animal, ensuring an adequate enclosure, issuing a permit or working with local authorities to address the concern.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to express the urgency of addressing this issue," the biologist wrote. "It is an accident waiting to happen."
</P>
<P>
The memo from the biologist was based on research but not on actual knowledge of Travis' behavior, DEP officials said.
</P>
<P>
DEP officials said in a statement that over the 13 years Travis was with Herold, the agency received only a small number of inquiries about Travis amid thousands in general about possession of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
"While these calls, e-mails or letters may have raised general concerns, they did not present specific information indicating that Travis had threatened the public safety or was exhibiting behavior that could lead to such a threat," DEP spokesman Dennis Schain said in a statement. "Given the horrific attack on Charla Nash we of course look back and ask if DEP should have pursued an aggressive approach to removing Travis the chimp from the Herolds' home in Stamford."
</P>
<P>
Gina McCarthy, Connecticut's environmental protection commissioner, whose agency was in charge of the matter, was promoted this month as the new assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation in Washington in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. She has said the memo from the biologist underscored the need for a clear, new law that would forbid ownership of potentially dangerous animals as pets and impose stiff penalties for those possessing them and blamed the failure to act on a communications problem and a lack of expertise in exotic animals at the agency.
</P>
<P>
"The truth of the matter is that DEP was presented with a complex situation and it is unclear if even after what would have undoubtedly been a long legal battle we would have been successful in removing him," Schain said.
</P>
<P>
Connecticut lawmakers approved a bill this month banning residents from owning large primates and other potentially dangerous animals, saying they are too unpredictable and inappropriate as pets. The legislation stemmed from the chimpanzee attack.

Reports: Coroner testifies at Italian trial
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coroner told a jury Saturday that a stab wound to the neck of a British student slain in Italy was caused by a shorter knife than the one believed to be the murder weapon, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Francesco Introna, taking the stand at the murder trial of U.S. student Amanda Knox and Italian co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito, also said that no more than a single attacker could have assaulted the victim on the night of the 2007 slaying, the ANSA news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Knox and her former boyfriend Sollecito are on trial in Perugia, central Italy, on charges of murder and sexual violence in the death of Knox's roommate Meredith Kercher. Both deny wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Introna, who was called to the stand by Sollecito's defense lawyers, testified that the cut on Kercher's neck was made with a knife with a 3-3 1/2-inch-long (8-9 centimeters long) blade, ANSA said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say that a 6 1/2-inch (16.5 centimeters) knife found at Sollecito's house matched the victim's wounds and could be te mude wapn.Thy ayth kif hd erhe'sDN o te blae and Knox's on the handle.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Kercher was killed during what had begun as a sex game. Her body was found in the apartment she shared with Knox on Nov. 2, 2007.
</P>
<P>
A third person, Rudy Hermann Guede of the Ivory Coast, was convicted in a separate trial last year and sentenced to 30 years in prison. He denies wrongdoing and has appealed his conviction.
</P>
<P>
Introna said that the bedroom where Kercher was killed was too small and that it would be "physically impossible" that three people could have attacked her, ANSA said. Helped by two assistants, he staged an attack to show how Kercher might have been assaulted from behind by only one person, ANSA said.
</P>
<P>
However, when cross-examined by prosecutors, Introna clarified he has never been to the house where Kercher was slain and used data collected by forensic experts to determine the size of the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Sollecito held Kercher by the shoulders from behind while Knox touched her with the point of a knife. Guede tried to sexually assault Kercher and then Knox fatally stabbed her in the throat, according to the prosecutors.

Five French tourists got a harrowing start to their New York visit: a wild police chase.
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the visitors, seeking a taxi, were instead steered toward an unlicensed van at John F. Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Police saw the tourists being taken to the unauthorized van. An officer reached through the van window to take the keys. But the driver sped off, knocking the officer to the ground. Other police chased the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Esther-Ethy Mamane, of Paris, told the New York Post that she and her fellow passengers "screamed and prayed."
</P>
<P>
She says it was "like something from a film."
</P>
<P>
The van sped along a highway and residential streets, hitting a gate and a truck. The suspects jumped out while the van was still moving. Officers, with guns drawn, quickly arrested them.
</P>
<P>
One passenger, 60-year-old Claudie Mamane of Paris, suffered an arm injury.

<P>
Five French tourists got a harrowing start to their New York visit: a wild police chase.
</P>
<P>
As they looked for a taxi at the Air France terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday morning, the visitors were lured to a van that was not licensed to provide taxi service, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesman John Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
Plainclothes police recognized the man who enticed the tourists, Ian McFarland, as a repeat offender previously arrested for corralling passengers into unlicensed cars. A port authority officer reached inside the van to try and grab the keys, but the driver, Khaalis Preacher, sped off with the tourists inside, knocking the officer to the ground, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
Port Authority police sped after the van, which snaked through residential streets and traveled about 7 miles (11 kilometers) before it crashed through a gate at a U.S. Postal Service facility in the East New York section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
The tourists said they were terrified and screamed and prayed during the chase.
</P>
<P>
"I am shocked. The whole thing was quite bizarre. We were very frightened," Paris resident Esther-Ethy Mamane told the New York Post. "It was like something from a film."
</P>
<P>
Her mother, 60-year-old Claudie Mamane, tried to jump from the van while it was still moving and injured her arm. Mamane was treated at a hospital and released. The other passengers were not injured.
</P>
<P>
Police say Preacher and McFarland jumped out while the van was still moving. The two were arrested on charges of unlawful solicitation, criminal trespass and possibly other charges, Kelly said. It wasn't clear if they had attorneys.
</P>
<P>
Gwen Dulugat, 27, also from Paris, said the van was going very fast.
</P>
<P>
"We're going zoom, zoom, zoom," she told the Post. "The police were fantastic. They were behind us all the time. And we were very lucky not to crash into any cars."

Port Authority police sped after the van, which snaked through residential streets and traveled about 7 miles (11 kilometers) through two boroughs before it crashed through a gate at a U.S. Postal Service facility in the East New York section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
The tourists said they screamed and prayed during the chase.
</P>
<P>
"I was scared," Paris resident Esther-Ethy Mamane, 26, said Wednesday at a news conference. Mamane and her mother, Claudine, traveled to New York to attend a religious seminar. She said she tried to keep the other passengers inside the van calm during the chaos.
</P>
<P>
Preacher and McFarland jumped out while the van was still moving. Mamane said there was smoke and the rear doors wouldn't open from the inside, so she jumped out the front as the van rolled and ran around to open the doors. Mamane's mother tried to jump from the van, fell and the vehicle rolled over her arm. She was treated at a hospital and released. Mamane and the other passengers, a woman and her parents, were not injured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police chased the two suspects on foot and arrested them on charges of unlawful solicitation, criminal trespass and possibly other charges, Kelly said. It wasn't clear whether they had attorneys.
</P>
<P>
Claudine and Esther-Ethy Mamane were given a bag full of New York City goodies, including tickets to the Broadway show "Chicago," passes to the Museum of Modern Art and transit fare cards at a news conference Wednesday. The other tourists decided not to attend.
</P>
<P>
The women, who spoke little English, said they were grateful to the Port Authority officers who never let the van out of their sight, and they are looking forward to a good trip in New York.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to be here; we love New York and New Yorkers," Claudine Mamane said through a French translator. "We never lost faith. And at any time we never thought it would end badly for us."

Philippine troops deployed to crush Abu Sayyaf
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MANILA, Philippines 2009-07-19 09:28:19 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of marines and army troops have been deployed to two islands in the southern Philippines for a new offensive aimed at eradicating al-Qaida-linked Abu Sayyaf militants by the end of this year, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 120,000-strong military has tried but failed to finish off the 400-member Abu Sayyaf in the past.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro ordered the military last week to launch new assaults against the Abu Sayyaf on Jolo and Basilan islands after the militants freed Italian hostage Eugenio Vagni -- the last of three Red Cross aid workers who were kidnapped on Jolo in January.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old Vagni, who was freed July 12, returned Saturday to his hometown of Montevarchi, which welcomed him with an open-air party in a piazza. The Abu Sayyaf earlier freed his colleagues, a Swiss and a Filipino.
</P>
<P>
Without any hostages to worry about, government forces can now carry out more offensives, regional military commander Maj. Gen. Benjamin Dolorfino said.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf also appear to be suffering recently from infighting, making them more vulnerable to attacks, Dolorfino said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to finish this soonest. That's our order," Dolorfino told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner, however, said troops have been given up to December to eradicate the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
A marine battalion of about 500 men was deployed Saturday to Basilan, where more than 60 Abu Sayyaf militants are based. An army reconnaissance company of about 100 soldiers was also shipped Saturday to nearby Jolo, where more than 300 militants are hiding, Dolorfino said.
</P>
<P>
About 200 members of a police special action force are being trained in southern Zamboanga city prior to deployment to Basilan in a few weeks, Dolorfino added.
</P>
<P>
A week ago in Basilan, the Abu Sayyaf beheaded a member suspected of being a military spy. The internal purge sparked fears among many militants. A key Abu Sayyaf commander in Jolo also opposed the kidnappings of the Red Cross workers for still-unclear reasons, Dolorfino said.
</P>
<P>
He said American counterterrorism forces will continue providing intelligence to help Filipino troops fight the militants.
</P>
<P>
Major offensives have failed to finish off the Abu Sayyaf in the past. A monthslong U.S.-backed campaign in 2006 called "Oplan Ultimatum" killed Abu Sayyaf chieftain Khadaffy Janjalani and other commanders but other leaders emerged and took charge.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations because of bombings, ransom kidnappings and beheadings of hostages. The group is suspected of receiving funds and training from al-Qaida.

US health club shooting gunman a 48-year-old man

<P>
A gunman who fired dozens of shots into a fitness center exercise class, killing three women and injuring nine, was a 48-year-old man from suburban Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
A person close to the Allegheny County coroner's office says the gunman was George Sodini who lived in Carnegie, just a few miles from the health club. The person wasn't authorized to comment on the gunman's identity and spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
In a Web site posted under his name, Sodini wrote rambling messages about his hatred of women and how he was tired of being rejected by them. He ended by writing, "Death Lives!"
</P>
<P>
After shooting the women Tuesday night the gunman turned the gun on himself.

Gunman at US health club was bitter over women
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BRIDGEVILLE, Pennsylvania 2009-08-06 09:17:57 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neighbors and friends mourned the losses of three women killed in a shooting rampage during an exercise class at a Pittsburgh-area gym as the shooter's online diary revealed a man who was ignored by women and referred to an "exit plan" to avenge his rage.
</P>
<P>
George Sodini went to a sprawling L.A. Fitness Club, turned out the lights on the Tuesday night "Latin impact" dance-aerobics class for women, and opened fire with three guns, spraying dozens of bullets before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
"He just had a lot of hatred in him and (was) hell-bent on committing this act, and no one was going to stop him," Allegheny County Police Superintendent Charles Moffatt said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
His 4,610-word Web diary appeared to be a nine-month chronology of his plans to end his misery with a shocking act of carnage at his gym. He couldn't understand why women ignored him, despite his best efforts to look nice. He hadn't had a girlfriend since 1984, hadn't slept with a woman in 19 years.
</P>
<P>
"Women just don't like me. There are 30 million desirable women in the US (my estimate) and I cannot find one. Not one of them finds me attractive," the 48-year-old computer programmer lamented.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear when the Web diary was posted and whether it had been updated online repeatedly since November or posted in its entirety recently.
</P>
<P>
The violence rocked the town of about 5,300 people just outside Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
Killed were Heidi Overmier, 46, of Carnegie, a sales manager at an amusement park; Jody Billingsley, 37, of Mount Lebanon, who worked for a medical-supply company; and Elizabeth Gannon, 49, of Pittsburgh, an X-ray technician at Allegheny General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
"She can't be gone," said Gannon's next-door neighbor and close friend, Carl Rady, who knew her for 35 years and said she loved to work out and pamper her dog. "It can't happen that way."
</P>
<P>
Six patients remained hospitalized, including the aerobics instructor, Mary Primis, 26, who was listed in fair condition. Primis is pregnant but said doctors told her the baby is fine.
</P>
<P>
Sodini did not have a relationship with any of his victims, according to police.
</P>
<P>
In his Web diary, Sodini wrote of planning the attack since at least November and said he tried to carry it out when the same weekly aerobics class met Jan. 6 but "chickened out," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
His anger stemmed from unfulfilled desire: The women at his gym "look so beautiful as to not be human," he wrote. He complained that women "don't even give me a second look ANYWHERE" even though he was tan and fit and claimed to dress well and smell nice.
</P>
<P>
He listed his status as "Never married." In a chilling addition, he recorded the date of his death as Aug. 4, 2009.
</P>
<P>
On that evening, he walked into the health club wearing black workout gear and a headband, and entered the class with multiple guns.
</P>
<P>
Jordan Solomon, 14, said she thought it was weird when a man walked into the all-female class and put a black duffel bag on the ground and reached into it.
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden all the lights went out and I turned around, he started firing. I turned around and I saw him holding a gun," she said. She ran out of the room and into the parking lot, bolting into a restaurant where she told the workers to call 911.
</P>
<P>
Sodini did not have a criminal record, and he legally bought the guns he used, police said.
</P>
<P>
Sodini's family issued a brief statement: "Our hearts and prayers are with the victims and their families and we pray for the full recovery of the survivors."
</P>
<P>
Sodini graduated in 1992 from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in computer science and had worked as a systems analyst at a Pittsburgh law firm since 1999.
</P>
<P>
A neighbor, Connie Fontanesi, said Sodini was so anti-social that "we really didn't learn anything personal about him."

The University of Pittsburgh says it won't accept an estimated $225,000 bequest from the gunman who committed suicide after killing three women and wounding nine others at a Pittsburgh-area health club.

Court papers of the intended estate gift were filed Friday by the brother and executor for 48-year-old George Sodini. University spokesman Robert Hill rejected the offer on Tuesday.

Prosecutor: Crime scene at US church ' horrific '
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ANADARKO, Oklahoma 2009-08-26 00:22:04 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scene inside a small Pentecostal church where a pastor was slain was "horrific," an Oklahoma district attorney said Tuesday, calling it the most brutal he has seen in nearly 20 years as a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
Police have released scant information about the killing of 61-year-old Carol Daniels, whose body was found Sunday inside the Christ Holy Sanctified Church, a weather-beaten building on a rundown block near downtown Anadarko. A preliminary autopsy deemed Daniels' death a homicide caused by "multiple sharp force injuries," said Cherokee Ballard, spokeswoman for the state Medical Examiner's office. She declined to discuss further details.
</P>
<P>
"I've prosecuted over 50 murders," District Attorney Bret Burns said. "This is the most horrific crime scene I've ever witnessed." He declined to elaborate, saying he did not want to jeopardize the investigation.
</P>
<P>
With little official word on the grisly killing, rumors in the town were swirling as people wondered what motivated the crime and who was responsible. Burns has called for a meeting of local pastors on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
State Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Jessica Brown also would not say anything about the time of Daniels' death, a possible motive or what evidence was collected at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Authorities do not have any suspects, she said, and were offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.
</P>
<P>
"Right now we have more questions than answers," Brown said. "The few answers we do have, we want to hold on to. That might help us in the long run."
</P>
<P>
Daniels made the 60-mile (96-kilometer) from Oklahoma City every week to preach, even though the church had no regular congregation. Her mother, Charlesetta Dunlap, said Daniels spent most of her time helping others and went to Anadarko consistently "with the expectation of someone wanting to seek the Lord."
</P>
<P>
Icey Simmons, 85, a resident of the Silver Crest Nursing Center, said she would see Daniels nearly every weekend when Simmons would go to the church for Sunday service or when Daniels would drop by.
</P>
<P>
"She and I would just go down there and pray by ourselves," she said. "I can't believe it.
</P>
<P>
"She was just as sweet as she could be, never did anything to hurt nobody."
</P>
<P>
Pastor Steve Palczynsky of the Cedar Hill Church of God in Anadarko said lack of official word is disconcerting and that he's taken extra steps to make sure his church is secure.
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I thought about, being human, was that maybe it was a serial killer and maybe he has something out for preachers, but the Lord takes care of us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tracy Schumpert, pastor of the town's First United Methodist Church, said members of the local clergy will meet Wednesday with Burns to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
"It's still very new, and we don't know what to think," she said. "Anything that happens like that, it's a community concern."

Slain pastor remembered as loving woman of God
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
OKLAHOMA CITY 2009-08-31 23:59:48 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As many as 1,000 people packed a church Monday for a nearly three-hour service to celebrate the life of a pastor who was found slain inside her church in southwest Oklahoma and to remember her as a sweet, loving woman of God.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen speakers, most who knew her and some who didn't, told mourners at Greater New Zion Baptist Church that Carol Daniels was not just a victim of a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
"Rain, sleet and snow -- she was faithful to the word. Not very many pastors are that committed to their ministry," Elder Steve Taplin said of Daniels, who traveled 60 miles from Oklahoma City every Sunday to the Worthy Temple Christ Holy Sanctified Church in Anadarko.
</P>
<P>
Daniels didn't have a regular congregation and often, she and several others would be the only ones at the church. Still, Daniels would travel to the town and open the small church in case someone needed to pray or hear the word of God.
</P>
<P>
It was during her Aug. 23 trip, while preparing her sermon, that she was killed, authorities said. An Anadarko police officer found her inside the church after a minister she was supposed to meet became concerned when Daniels didn't answer the door.
</P>
<P>
According to a forensics expert who reviewed a preliminary autopsy report, Daniels suffered numerous gashes to her neck and throat, as well as stab wounds to her chest, back, stomach and hands. Her body was moved into an unnatural position after she was killed, investigators have said.
</P>
<P>
Daniels' brother, Ivan Henderson, told mourners to pray for three things.
</P>
<P>
"Pray so that we can forgive the person who did this," said Henderson, a minister who lives in Cleveland. "Pray that God gives favor to the police and the investigators, that God gives them strength."
</P>
<P>
Henderson also urged mourners to pray that the person or people who killed his sister be caught so they could not kill again.
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case. It has asked FBI experts in fields like behavioral science to help find the killer or killers.

<P>
Sky Blue fired its first coach, Ian Sawyers, in May. Replacement Kelly Lindsey abruptly resigned late in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
"After I visited New Jersey and the Sky Blue FC organization, there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to be a part of this family," Miettinen said. "I am looking forward to coaching these dynamic athletes, and to working hard to prepare for the 2010 season and ensure the success of this team in the world's most competitive women's football league."
</P>
<P>
Miettinen was an assistant at Franklin Pierce College in 1999, helping her alma mater to its fourth national championship in five years. The Finn joined the coaching staff at Barry University in Miami Shores, Florida in 2001, and then became an assistant at Florida State in 2005.
</P>
<P>
"We decided our goal was to have a female coach since we are a female team in a female league," general manager Gerry Marrone said. "Pauliina is an experienced player at the highest level. Her successful versatility as a player is matched by her ability as a coach, having had success at both the American collegiate level and internationally in Finland. What's more, she is a great communicator with a dynamic personality, supplemented by her training in psychology."
</P>
<P>
Rampone called Miettinen a wonderful person who comes highly recommended.
</P>
<P>
"Pauliina will bring a new style and flavor from her experiences as an elite player and coach in Finland, and I look forward to assisting her with knowledge of the league and our team," Rampone said. "The Sky Blue FC players adjust well, and I know we will achieve success together."

US chimp victim seeks to sue state
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW HAVEN, Connecticut 2009-11-04 22:21:35 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The family of a Connecticut woman mauled and blinded by a chimpanzee sought Wednesday to sue the state for $150 million, saying officials failed to prevent the attack.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Charla Nash's family filed a notice Wednesday with the state's Office of Claims Commissioner asking for permission to sue the state.
</P>
<P>
The 200-pound (90-kilogram) chimpanzee named Travis went berserk in February when his owner, Sandra Herold, asked Nash to help lure him back into her house in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
The animal chewed off Nash's hands, nose, lips and eyelids; she remains in stable condition at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
A Department of Environmental Protection biologist warned state officials before the attack that Travis could seriously hurt someone if he felt threatened, noting that he was large and strong.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the evidence will show that the state, acting through the Department of Environmental Protection, failed to adequately address a serious public safety issue that resulted in tragic consequences for our client," said Matt Newman, attorney for Nash's family.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Wednesday that his office is reviewing the claim. He said that he is sympathetic over the "horrific tragedy" but that the planned lawsuit "seems unprecedented in size."
</P>
<P>
Nash's family earlier filed a $50 million lawsuit against Herold, saying she was negligent and reckless for lacking the ability to control "a wild animal with violent propensities."
</P>
<P>
Herold's attorney has called the attack work-related and said her family's case should be treated like a workers' compensation claim. The strategy, if successful, would limit potential damages in the case and insulate the chimp owner from personal liability.
</P>
<P>
The animal, which was shot and killed by police, had also escaped in 2003 from his owner's car and led police on a chase for hours in downtown Stamford. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
Records obtained by The Associated Press through a state open-records request show the state began receiving warnings immediately after that event.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection officials have said that over the 13 years Travis was with Herold, the agency received only a few inquiries about Travis among thousands in general about possession of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
They said the memo from the biologist underscored the need for a clear, new law that would forbid ownership of potentially dangerous animals as pets and impose stiff penalties for those possessing them, and they blamed the failure to act on a communications problem and a lack of expertise in exotic animals at the agency.
</P>
<P>
Police fatally shot the 14-year-old chimp when he tried to attack an officer responding to the assault on Nash on Feb. 16. Test results showed that Travis had the anti-anxiety drug Xanax in his system, but investigators don't know whether the drug played a role.

Woman attacked by chimp reveals face on ' Oprah '
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CHICAGO 2009-11-12 02:11:33 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman who was attacked by a chimpanzee revealed her heavily disfigured face on Oprah Winfrey's television show, saying she is blind and has to eat through a straw, but isn't angry.
</P>
<P>
"I don't even think about it," Charla Nash said on Wednesday's episode of "The Oprah Winfrey Show." "And there's no time for that anyways because I need to heal, you know, not look backwards."
</P>
<P>
Winfrey removed Nash's hat and veil to reveal her face, which was swollen and damaged beyond recognition. She had a large scar near the bottom of her face and a large piece of skin where her nose had been.
</P>
<P>
The Feb. 16 attack occurred when the 200-pound (90-kilogram) animal's owner, Sandra Herold, asked Nash, her friend and employee, to help lure the animal back into her house in Stamford, Connecticut. The chimpanzee ripped off Nash's hands, nose, lips and eyelids.
</P>
<P>
Police shot and killed the animal. Nash has been hospitalized since. She remains in stable condition at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Nash said she didn't remember anything from the attack and doesn't want to.
</P>
<P>
"I want to get healthy," she said. "I don't want to wake up with nightmares."
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Wednesday night with The Associated Press, Nash said she repeatedly warned Herold that the primate was dangerous and could hurt someone. Nash said she saw the chimpanzee throw large objects around his cage, including a desk and 55-gallon (208-liter) plastic drum, flash his teeth and pound the bars so violently his hands would bleed and the cage had to be rewelded.
</P>
<P>
"They had to weld the cage because he was starting to break out from hitting it so much," Nash said.
</P>
<P>
Another time Herold told workers at her house they had to leave, Nash said.
</P>
<P>
Nash said she was afraid of Travis, who was typically locked in his cage when she saw him. Nash said she told Herold eight or 10 times he was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
"I always told her you have to get rid of him, he's going to hurt somebody someday. He's too dangerous," Nash said. "You can't control him, and he's going to hurt somebody."
</P>
<P>
Nash, who occasionally fed Travis oatmeal in his cage, said she told Herold that Travis did not have enough room to run around.
</P>
<P>
"Sandy would say, 'I know, but it's hard,'" explaining that she believed if she gave him up, he would not get the same level of care she provided.
</P>
<P>
Herold had black and blue marks from Travis, but she would say they were playing around, Nash said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Herold, Nash said, "I feel like I've been thrown under a bus."
</P>
<P>
The Feb. 16 attack occurred when Herold asked her friend Nash to help lure the animal back into her house in Stamford. The chimpanzee ripped off Nash's hands, nose, lips and eyelids.
</P>
<P>
Herold's attorney could not be reached on his cell phone Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Nash told Winfrey she is not in pain but can't breathe through her nose and has to eat through a straw. She said she doesn't touch her face often.
</P>
<P>
"I know that I have my forehead," Nash said. "It feels like just patches of tape or gauze or covering, covering my face."
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until a couple of weeks ago, when an eye doctor told Nash she no longer had eyes, that she realized she would never see again, she said. Nash said she doesn't ask many questions about her injuries.
</P>
<P>
"It's like less for me to worry about if I don't know," she said.
</P>
<P>
Nash's family has filed a $50 million lawsuit against Herold, saying she was negligent and reckless for lacking the ability to control "a wild animal with violent propensities."
</P>
<P>
Herold's attorney has argued the attack was work-related and the case should be treated as a workers' compensation claim. Herold's attorney, Robert Golger, provided AP with a statement, saying Herold wishes Nash the best.
</P>
<P>
"All of Sandy's hopes and prayers are with Charla and her daughter in this challenging time," the statement read. "Sandy hopes and prays for a full and speedy recovery."
</P>
<P>
Nash denied she was Herold's employee.
</P>
<P>
Nash's family filed notice with Connecticut's Office of Claims Commissioner this month, asking for permission to sue the state for $150 million, saying officials failed to prevent the attack. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has said his office is reviewing the claim.
</P>
<P>
Herold owned the 14-year-old chimp nearly all its life. When he was younger, Travis starred in TV commercials and took part in a television pilot.
</P>
<P>
A state biologist had warned Connecticut officials that the chimp could hurt someone. The animal had the anti-anxiety drug Xanax in its system, according to toxicology tests, but investigators don't know whether the drug played a role in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Nash said the animal had once ripped out a hunk of her hair and grabbed her arm a few times.
</P>
<P>
"You could feel the strength he had," she told AP.
</P>
<P>
Nash said she wants to warn people about potential dangers posed by exotic animals.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to put across to people's minds that these exotic animals are very dangerous and they shouldn't be around," Nash said on Winfrey's show. "There's a place for them that is not in residential areas."
</P>
<P>
Even if she isn't feeling well, Nash said she pushes herself to go for a walk during the day. She wears a veil so she doesn't scare people and to avoid insults.
</P>
<P>
"I'm the same person I've always been," she said. "I just look different."

-- Apr. 1, 2008. The Court of Cassation, Italy's top criminal court, rejects requests by defense lawyers for the release of Knox, Sollecito and Guede and orders them to remain in jail.
</P>
<P>
-- Sept. 9, 2008. Guede's lawyers ask for a fast-track trial. The procedure, in which evidence is presented in document form and no witnesses testify, is quicker and leads to lesser sentences if the suspect is found guilty.
</P>
<P>
-- Sept. 16, 2008. Knox appears in court at the opening of a preliminary hearing to determine whether she and the other two suspects must face trial. Sollecito is not in court. Guede, who attends the hearing, is granted the fast-track trial sought by his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
-- Oct. 28, 2008. Judge Paolo Micheli orders Knox and Sollecito to stand trial on charges of murder and sexual assault. The same judge also convicts Guede of murder and sexual assault and sentences him to 30 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
-- Jan. 16, 2009. Trial of Knox and Sollecito opens in Perugia before presiding Judge Giancarlo Massei.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- June 12, 2009. Knox takes the stand. She tells the court that she was shocked by Kercher's death, offers an alibi for the night of the murder and says police beat her into making a false statement in the case.
</P>
<P>
-- Nov. 18, 2009. Guede's appeals trial opens. Guede testifies that he heard Kercher arguing with Knox minutes before she was slain.
</P>
<P>
-- Nov 21, 2009. Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini requests life sentences for Knox and Sollecito. Knox addresses the court minutes later to say the accusations against her are "pure fantasy."

Knox convicted, sentenced to 26 years in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PERUGIA, Italy 2009-12-05 00:32:04 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American college student Amanda Knox was found guilty of murdering her British roommate and sentenced to 26 years in prison early Saturday after a year-long trial that gripped Italy and drew intense media attention.
</P>
<P>
Her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito was also convicted and sentenced to 25 years. They were also convicted of sexual assault in the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher, a 21-year-old student from England.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the judge read the verdict just after midnight following some 13 hours of deliberations, Knox began weeping and murmured, "No, no," then hugged one of her lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, the 22-year-old Knox, who is from Seattle and the 25-year-old Sollecito, were put in police vans with sirens blaring and driven back to jail.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had sought life imprisonment, Italy's stiffest sentence. Courts often give less severe punishment than what prosecutors demand.
</P>
<P>
The American's father, Curt Knox, asked if he would fight on for his daughter, replied, with tears in his eyes: "Hell, yes."
</P>
<P>
"This is just wrong," her stepmother, Cassandra Knox, said, turning around immediately after hearing the verdict. Her family had insisted she was innocent and a victim of character assassination.
</P>
<P>
One of Knox's lawyers, Luciano Ghirga, was asked if she was desperate.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I challenge anyone not to be," he replied.
</P>
<P>
A group of local youths who gathered outside the courthouse shouted insults and "assassin" at the Knox entourage as they walked in to hear the verdict.
</P>
<P>
Knox and Sollecito were charged with murder and sexual assault in the slaying of Kercher more than two years ago. All three were studying in Perugia in Italy's central Umbria region at the time.
</P>
<P>
Kercher's body was found in a pool of blood with her throat slit on Nov. 2, 2007, in the bedroom of the house she shared with Knox. Prosecutors contended the 21-year-old Leeds University student was murdered the previous night.
</P>
<P>
Kercher family lawyer Francesco Maresca called the verdict and sentence "satisfactory" for the family, but he acknowledged that the defendants' loved ones were also pained.
</P>
<P>
"There is deep suffering on all sides," Maresca said, adding that the victim's family planned to hold a news conference late on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Knox and Sollecito had been jailed since shortly after the slaying.
</P>
<P>
Relatives and friends in Seattle clasped hands as they watched TV and waited for the verdict. Her uncle, Mick Huff, cried, "Oh God, no" when it was announced.
</P>
<P>
Other friends buried their faces in their hands and shook their heads.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't listen to the facts of the case," said Elisabeth Huff, Knox' grandmother. "All they did was listen to the media's lies."
</P>
<P>
Madison Paxton, Knox's friend from university, said: "They're convicting a made-up person," Paxton said. "They they're convicting 'foxy Knoxy.' That's not Amanda."
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors contend on the night of the murder, Knox and Sollecito met at the apartment where Kercher and Knox lived. They say a fourth person was there, Rudy Hermann Guede, an Ivory Coast citizen who has been convicted in the murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Guede, who is appealing his conviction, says he was in the house the night of the murder but did not kill Kercher.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution says Knox and Kercher started arguing, and that Knox joined the two men in brutally attacking and sexually assaulting the Briton under "the fumes of drugs and possibly alcohol."
</P>
<P>
Throughout the trial, prosecutors depicted Knox as a promiscuous and manipulative she-devil whose personality clashed with her roommate's. They say Knox had grown to hate Kercher.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the most intimate details of Knox's life were examined, from her lax hygiene -- allegedly a point of contention with Kercher -- to her sex life, even including a sex toy.
</P>
<P>
Knox said Kercher was a friend whose slaying shocked and saddened her.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers have described the American, who made the dean's list at the University of Washington, as a smart and cheerful woman, at one point even comparing her to film character Amelie, the innocent and dreamy girl in the 2001 French movie of the same title.
</P>
<P>
That is the film Knox and Sollecito say they were watching at his home on the night of the murder, where they say they smoked marijuana and had sex. Knox said she went home the next morning to find the door to the house open and Kercher dead.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution maintains that a 6 1/2-inch knife authorities found at Sollecito's house could be the murder weapon; they say Kercher's DNA was found on the blade and Knox's on the handle. However, defense lawyers argue the knife was too big to match Kercher's wounds and the amount of DNA collected was too small to determine with certainty whose it was.
</P>
<P>
The defense maintained there was not enough evidence for a conviction and no clear motive.
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutor Manuela Comodi said violent crimes can lack a motive. "We live at a time where violence is purposeless," she told the jury.
</P>
<P>
Knox gave contradictory versions of the night of the slaying, saying at one point she was home and had to cover her ears to block out Kercher's screams and accusing a Congolese man of the killing. The man, Patrick Diya Lumumba, owns a pub in Perugia where Knox worked. He was jailed briefly but was later cleared and is seeking defamation damages from Knox.
</P>
<P>
Knox later contended that police pressure led her to initially accuse an innocent man.

A prosecutor says he does not plan to charge the owner of a chimpanzee that mauled and blinded a woman.
</P>
<P>
Connecticut State's Attorney David Cohen said Monday that there is no evidence that Sandra Herold of Stamford was aware of risk that her chimpanzee posed to other people and disregarded it.
</P>
<P>
The 200-pound (91-kilogram) chimpanzee went berserk in February after Herold asked Charla Nash to help lure him back into her house. The chimp ripped off Nash's hands, nose, lips and eyelids.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that there was no record of the animal attacking anyone previously and that it had interacted with Nash many times before the attack.
</P>
<P>
Nash's family is suing Herold for $50 million and wants to sue the state for $150 million.

<P>
A woman who owned a chimpanzee that mauled and blinded a woman won't be charged because there's no evidence she knowingly disregarded any risk the animal posed, a prosecutor said Monday.
</P>
<P>
State's Attorney David Cohen said it wasn't evident that Sandra Herold of Stamford had been deliberately reckless in handling the animal.
</P>
<P>
The 200-pound (91-kilogram) chimpanzee went berserk in February after Herold asked Charla Nash to help lure him back into her house. The animal ripped off Nash's hands, nose, lips and eyelids.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that there was no record of the animal attacking anyone previously, and that it had interacted with Nash many times before the attack.
</P>
<P>
The decision not to file charges "does not in any way minimize the horror that we all feel with what occurred and with the horrendous injuries suffered by Ms. Nash," Cohen said. "Our prayers go out to her and her family."
</P>
<P>
Messages were left for attorneys for Herold and Nash, who revealed her heavily disfigured face last month on "The Oprah Winfrey Show."
</P>
<P>
Nash's family is suing Herold for $50 million and wants to sue the state for $150 million. Nash's family has said Herold was negligent and reckless for lacking the ability to control "a wild animal with violent propensities."
</P>
<P>
A biologist for the state Department of Environmental Protection warned officials before the attack that Travis the chimp could seriously hurt someone if he felt threatened, noting that he was large and strong.
</P>
<P>
But Cohen said Monday there's no evidence those concerns were conveyed to Herold.
</P>
<P>
Herold's attorney has called the attack work-related and said her family's case should be treated like a workers' compensation claim. The strategy, if successful, would limit potential damages in the case and insulate the chimp owner from personal liability.
</P>
<P>
Test results showed that Travis had the anti-anxiety drug Xanax in his system. Cohen said it is impossible to say what effect, if any, the drug had on the animal.
</P>
<P>
The chimp, which was shot and killed by police, had also escaped in 2003 from his owner's car and led police on a chase for hours in downtown Stamford. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
Records obtained by The Associated Press through an open-records request show the state began receiving warnings immediately after that event.
</P>
<P>
Nash's attorney has said the environmental department had information for at least five years that would have allowed the agency to remove Travis from the home.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection officials have said that during the 13 years Travis was with Herold, the agency received only a few inquiries about the chimp among thousands in general about possession of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
They said the memo from the biologist underscored the need for a clear, new law that would forbid ownership of potentially dangerous animals as pets and impose stiff penalties for those possessing them, and they blamed the failure to act on a communications problem and a lack of expertise in exotic animals at the agency.

Appeals court upholds conviction in Kercher murder
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PERUGIA, Italy 2009-12-22 17:38:04 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Italian appeals court on Tuesday upheld the guilty verdict for a man convicted of murdering a British student, but cut his prison sentence to 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers said the eight-member jury emerged from more than four hours of deliberations and upheld the conviction on charges of murder and sexual violence for Rudy Hermann Guede.
</P>
<P>
Guede, who is from Ivory Coast, denies killing Meredith Kercher and last year was sentenced to 30 years in a fast track trial he had requested.
</P>
<P>
Also convicted in the case, but in a separate trial, are Amanda Knox, the U.S. student who was the victim's roommate in Perugia, and Raffaele Sollecito, Knox's boyfriend at the time of the 2007 slaying.
</P>
<P>
Knox and Sollecito deny wrongdoing and are expected to appeal their convictions. They were sentenced earlier this month to 26 and 25 years in prison, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Kercher, a Leeds University student, was found in a pool of blood with her throat slit on Nov. 2, 2007, in the bedroom of an apartment in the central Italian town. Prosecutors believe she was killed the night before in a drug-fueled sex game involving Guede, Knox and Sollecito.
</P>
<P>
Guede, who was arrested in Germany shortly after the killing, has admitted being at the scene of the crime the night of the murder, but said he did not kill Kercher.
</P>
<P>
Guede was in court Tuesday when the verdict was read and told reporters afterward: "I am not happy because I am innocent."
</P>
<P>
Kercher family lawyer Francesco Maresca said he was satisfied that Guede was found guilty but was "surprised" that the sentence was cut by almost half.
</P>
<P>
He said the ruling recognized some extenuating circumstances for Guede but it will be necessary to wait for the court's reasonings, expected within 90 days, to know more details. Both the prosecution and the defense could appeal the verdict to Italy's top criminal court.
</P>
<P>
Guede's lawyers had requested that the verdict be overturned and he be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
According to the ANSA news agency, defense attorney Valter Biscotti likened Guede to Sam Sheppard, the U.S. doctor who was first convicted and later acquitted of killing his wife in 1954 and whose case inspired the movie and television series "The Fugitive."
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Pietro Catalani asked the court on Tuesday to uphold the guilty verdict.

Haiti detains Americans taking kids across border
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 2010-01-31 03:25:27 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten Americans were detained by Haitian police on Saturday as they tried to bus 33 children across the border into the Dominican Republic, allegedly without proper documents.
</P>
<P>
The Baptist church members from Idaho called it a "Haitian Orphan Rescue Mission," meant to save abandoned children from the chaos following Haiti's earthquake. Their plan was to scoop up 100 kids and take them by bus to a rented hotel at a beach resort in the Dominican Republic, where they planned to establish an orphanage.
</P>
<P>
Whether they realized it or not, these Americans -- the first known to be taken into custody since the Jan. 12 earthquake -- put themselves in the middle of a firestorm in Haiti, where government leaders have suspended adoptions and alleged -- without offering evidence -- that aid workers have been stealing children for organ trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"In this chaos the government is in right now we were just trying to do the right thing," the group's leader, Laura Silsby, told reporters at the judicial police headquarters in the capital, where the Americans were being held pending a Monday hearing before a judge.
</P>
<P>
Silsby said they only had the best of intentions and paid no money for the children, whom she said they obtained from well-known Haitian pastor named Jean Sanbil of the Sharing Jesus Ministries.
</P>
<P>
Silsby, 40, of Boise, Idaho, was asked if she didn't consider it naive to cross the border without adoption papers at a time when Haitians are so concerned about child trafficking. "By no means are we any part of that. That's exactly what we are trying to combat," she said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Haiti sent consular officials, who met with the detained Americans and gave them bug spray and MREs to eat, according to Sean Lankford of Meridian, Idaho, whose wife and 18-year-old daughter were being held.
</P>
<P>
"They have to go in front of a judge on Monday," Lankford told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"There are allegations of child trafficking and that really couldn't be farther from the truth," he added. The children "were going to get the medical attention they needed. They were going to get the clothes and the food and the love they need to be healthy and to start recovering from the tragedy that just happened."
</P>
<P>
Haiti has imposed new controls on adoptions since the earthquake, which left thousands of children separated from their parents or orphaned. The government now requires Prime Minister Max Bellerive to personally authorize the departure of any child as a way to prevent child trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Silsby said they had documents from the Dominican government, but did not seek any paperwork from the Haitian authorities before taking 33 children from 2 months to 12 years old to the border, where Haitian police stopped them Friday evening. She said the children were brought to her by distant relatives, and that the only ones to be put up for adoption would be those without close family to care for them.
</P>
<P>
The 10 Americans include members of the Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Idaho and the East Side Baptist Church in Twin Falls, Idaho, as well as people from Texas and Kansas. Idaho friends and relatives have been in touch with them through text messages and phone calls, Lankford said.
</P>
<P>
"The plan was never to go adopt all these kids. The plan was to create this orphanage where kids could live. And kids get adopted out of orphanages. People go down and they're going to fall in love with these kids, and many of these kids will end up getting adopted."
</P>
<P>
"Of course I'm concerned for my wife and my daughter," he added. "They were hoping to make a difference and be able to help those kids."
</P>
<P>
The group described their plans on a Web site where they also asked for tax-deductible contributions, saying they would "gather" 100 orphans and bus them to the Dominican resort of Cabarete, before building a more permanent orphanage in the Dominican town of Magante.
</P>
<P>
"Given the urgent needs from this earthquake, God has laid upon our hearts the need to go now versus waiting until the permanent facility is built," the group wrote.

Parents willingly gave children to US Baptists
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CALLEBAS, Haiti 2010-02-03 21:28:29 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents in this struggling village above Haiti's capital said Wednesday they willingly handed their children to American missionaries who showed up in a bus promising to give them a better life -- contradicting claims by the Baptist group's leader that the children came from orphanages and distant relatives.
</P>
<P>
The 10 Baptists, most from Idaho, were arrested last week trying to take 33 Haitian children across the border into the Dominican Republic without the required documents, according to outraged Haitian officials, who have called them child traffickers.
</P>
<P>
An investigating magistrate was questioning the five men Wednesday after interrogating the women a day earlier. A district attorney will then determine whether to file charges, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Haitian parents told The Associated Press they surrendered their children on Jan. 28, two days after a local orphanage worker acting on behalf of the Baptists convened nearly the entire village of about 500 people on a dirt soccer pitch to present the Americans' offer.
</P>
<P>
The orphanage worker, Issac Adrien, said he told the villagers their children would be educated at a home in the Dominican Republic so that they might eventually return to take care of their families.
</P>
<P>
Many parents jumped at the offer. The village school had collapsed and their homes were destroyed in Haiti's catastrophic Jan. 12 quake, and they had no money to feed the children, they said.
</P>
<P>
"It's only because the bus was full that more children didn't go," said Melanie Augustin, a 58-year-old who gave her 10-year-old daughter, Jovin, to the Americans. Ironically, Augustin had adopted Jovin because her birth parents couldn't afford to care for her.
</P>
<P>
Adrien said he brought the Americans to this mountain village where people scrape by growing carrots, peppers and onions. He told the AP he met their leader, Laura Silsby of Boise, Idaho, at a school in Port-au-Prince two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
Silsby said she was looking for homeless children, Adrien said, adding that he went that very day to talk to the parents in Callebas.
</P>
<P>
In a jailhouse interview Saturday, Silsby told the AP that most of the children had been delivered to the Americans by distant relatives, while some came from orphanages that had collapsed in the quake.
</P>
<P>
The missionaries' lawyer, Jorge Puello, told the AP on Wednesday "they willingly accepted kids they knew were not orphans because the parents said they would starve otherwise."
</P>
<P>
The parents of four children taken by Silsby said the Americans took down contact information for all the families and assured them that a relative would be able to visit them in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
Silsby's Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Idaho, had begun planning last year to build an orphanage, school and church in Magante, on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic. Their plan was to work with U.S. adoption agencies to find "loving Christian parents" for Haitian and Dominican children. When the quake struck, the church members decided to act immediately, renting a hotel in a nearby Dominican beach resort and hiring a bus to collect children from the disaster area.
</P>
<P>
Adrien said he had no knowledge of the group's larger plans; villagers said they were told none of their children would be offered for adoption.
</P>
<P>
Laurentius Lelly, a 27-year-old computer technician, said he gave up his two children, ages 4 and 6, because Silsby had previously visited the area and earned people's trust.
</P>
<P>
Lelly said he is no longer so sure about her trustworthiness, and said he was worried the Haitian judicial system would fail to properly investigate the case. No Haitian police or social welfare investigators have visited the village since the Americans were arrested at the border, the parents said.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to find out if these people were really going to help the kids or were trying to steal them," Lelly said.
</P>
<P>
The children, ranging in age from 2 to 12, are now being cared for at the Austrian-run SOS Children's Village in Port-au-Prince. An official there, Patricia Vargas, said none of the children who were old enough to talk said they were parentless. "Up until now we have not encountered any who say they are an orphan," she said.
</P>
<P>
A Haitian-born pastor who apparently helped the Baptist group insisted Wednesday the Americans had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jean Sainvil told the AP that some of the children were orphans and might have been put up for adoption. Children with parents were to be kept in the Dominican Republic, and would not lose contact with their families, Sainvil said in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody agreed that they knew where the children were going. The parents were told, and we confirmed they would be allowed to see the children and even take them back if need be," he said.
</P>
<P>
Most parents said they wouldn't know what to do if they had to take the children back.
</P>
<P>
"I am living in a tent with a friend," said Lelly, who said most of his wife's close relatives were killed. "My main concern is that if the kids come back I'm not going to be able to feed them."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Max Bellerive has suggested the Americans could be prosecuted in the United States because Haiti's shattered court system may not be able to cope with a trial.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear now that they were trying to cross the border without papers. It is clear now that some of the children have live parents. And it is clear now that they knew what they were doing was wrong," Bellerive told the AP.
</P>
<P>
The White House has said the case remains in Haitian hands for now.

US Baptists to appear before Haitian prosecutor
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CALLEBAS, Haiti 2010-02-04 12:55:25 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents in this quake-wracked Haitian village unable to feed or clothe their children handed the youngsters over to a group of American missionaries who promised to give them a better life.
</P>
<P>
In a testament to the misery of a nation that was the western hemisphere's poorest even before a Jan. 12 earthquake, many Callebas parents say they wouldn't know what to do if they had to take the children back.
</P>
<P>
"I am living in a tent with a friend," said Laurentius Lelly, a 27-year-old computer technician who gave up his two children, ages 4 and 6. "My main concern is that if the kids come back I'm not going to be able to feed them."
</P>
<P>
The Americans were to appear Thursday before a prosecutor who will decide whether to file charges or release them, Communications Minister Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue told the AP.
</P>
<P>
The stories the parents told The Associated Press on Wednesday in this village a half hour from the capital contradict claims by the Baptist group's leader that the children came from orphanages or were handed over by distant relatives.
</P>
<P>
The 10 Baptists, most from Idaho, were arrested last week trying to take 33 Haitian children across the border into the Dominican Republic without the required documents, according to Haitian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Standing amid piles of debris that used to be their homes and the makeshift shelters of tin and plastic sheeting that have replaced them, the people of Callebas told how they came to surrender their children.
</P>
<P>
It all began last week when a local orphanage worker, fluent in English and acting on behalf of the Baptists, convened nearly the entire village of 500 people on a dirt soccer field to present the Americans' offer.
</P>
<P>
Isaac Adrien, 20, told his neighbors the missionaries would educate their children in the neighboring Dominican Republic, the villagers said, adding that they were also assured they would be free to visit their children there.
</P>
<P>
Many parents jumped at the offer.
</P>
<P>
"It's only because the bus was full that more children didn't go," said Melanie Augustin, a 58-year-old who gave her 10-year-old daughter, Jovin, to the Americans.
</P>
<P>
Adrien said he met the Baptists' leader, Laura Silsby of Meridian, Idaho, in Port-au-Prince on Jan. 26. She told him she was looking for homeless children, he said, and he knew exactly where to find them.
</P>
<P>
He rushed home to Callebas, where people scrape by growing carrots, peppers and onions. That very day, he had a list of 20 children.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Puello, the group's lawyer, said Wednesday by phone from the Dominican Republic that the missionaries "willingly accepted kids they knew were not orphans because the parents said they would starve otherwise."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Max Bellerive has suggested the Americans could be prosecuted in the United States because Haiti's shattered court system may not be able to cope with a trial.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the attempt to bring undocumented children out of Haiti was "unfortunate whatever the motivation" and the Americans should have followed proper procedures. She said U.S. officials were in discussions with Haitian authorities about how to resolve the case.
</P>
<P>
Lelly said he was worried the Haitian judicial system would not properly investigate the case. No Haitian police or social welfare investigators have visited the village since the Americans were arrested at the border, the parents said.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to find out if these people were really going to help the kids or were trying to steal them," Lelly said.
</P>
<P>
The children, ranging in age from 2 to 12, are being cared for at the Austrian-run SOS Children's Village in Port-au-Prince.

A Haitian-born pastor who said he worked as an unpaid consultant for the group insisted the Baptists had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jean Sainvil said some of the children were orphans and might have been put up for adoption. Children with parents were to be kept in the Dominican Republic, and would not lose contact with their families, Sainvil said in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody agreed that they knew where the children were going. The parents were told, and we confirmed they would be allowed to see the children and even take them back if need be," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sainvil stressed that in Haiti it is not uncommon for parents who can't support their children to send them to orphanages.

Attorney: 10 US Baptists charged with child kidnap
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 2010-02-04 20:44:35 UTC

<P>
Ten members of a U.S. missionary group who said they were trying to rescue 33 child victims of Haiti's devastating earthquake were charged with child kidnapping and criminal association on Thursday, their lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
Edwin Coq said after a court hearing that a judge found sufficient evidence to charge the Americans, who were arrested Friday at Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic. Coq attended Thursday's hearing and represents the entire group in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
Group leader Laura Silsby has said they were trying to take orphans and abandoned children to an orphanage in the neighboring Dominican Republic. She acknowledged they had not sought permission from Haitian officials, but said they just meant to help victims of the quake.
</P>
<P>
The children taken from the group, ranging in age from 2 to 12, were being cared for at the Austrian-run SOS Children's Village in Port-au-Prince on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. citizens, most of them members of an Idaho-based church group, were whisked away from the closed court hearing to jail in Port-au-Prince, the capital. Silsby waved and smiled faintly to reporters but declined to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
Coq said that under Haiti's legal system, there won't be an open trial, but a judge will consider the evidence and could render a verdict in about three months.
</P>
<P>
Coq said a Haitian prosecutor told him the Americans were charged because they had the children in their possession. No one from the Haitian government could be reached immediately for comment.
</P>
<P>
Each kidnapping count carries a possible sentence of five to 15 years in prison. Each criminal association count has a potential sentence of three to nine years.
</P>
<P>
Coq said that nine of the 10 knew nothing about the alleged scheme, or that paperwork for the children was not in order.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to do everything I can to get the nine out," Coq said. That would still leave mission leader Laura Silsby facing charges.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said in Washington the U.S. was open to discuss "other legal avenues" for the defendants -- an apparent reference to the Haitian prime minister's earlier suggestion that Haiti could consider sending the Americans back to the United States for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Several parents of the children in Callebas, a quake-wracked Haitian village near the capital, told The Associated Press Wednesday they had handed over their children willingly because they were unable to feed or clothe their children and the American missionaries promised to give them a better life.
</P>
<P>
Their accounts contradicted statements by Silsby, of Meridian, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
In a jailhouse interview Saturday, Silsby told the AP that most of the children had been delivered to the Americans by distant relatives, while some came from orphanages that had collapsed in the quake.
</P>
<P>
"They are very precious kids that have lost their homes and families and are so deeply in need of, most of all, God's love and his compassion," she said.
</P>
<P>
In Callebas, parents said a local orphanage worker, fluent in English and acting on behalf of the Baptists, had convened nearly the entire village of 500 people on a dirt soccer field to present the Americans' offer.
</P>
<P>
Isaac Adrien, 20, told his neighbors the missionaries would educate their children in the neighboring Dominican Republic, the villagers said, adding that they were also assured they would be free to visit their children there.
</P>
<P>
Many parents jumped at the offer.
</P>
<P>
Adrien said he met Silsby in Port-au-Prince on Jan. 26. She told him she was looking for homeless children, he said, and he knew exactly where to find them.
</P>
<P>
He rushed home to Callebas, where people scrape by growing carrots, peppers and onions. That very day, he had a list of 20 children.
</P>
<P>
As they loaded children onto a bus in Callebas on Jan. 28, the Americans took down contact information for all the families and assured them a relative would be able to visit them in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Americans' journey began last summer after Silsby and her former nanny, 24-year-old Charisa Coulter, resolved to establish an orphanage for Haitian children in the Dominican Republic. Coulter is among the jailed Americans.
</P>
<P>
They began buying up used clothing and collecting donations from their Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian and in November, Silsby registered the New Life Children's Refuge Inc., the nonprofit organization coordinating the rescue mission. It listed the address of her now-foreclosed home in Meridian as its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Then the quake hit. Silsby and Coulter moved into high gear, gathering donations and assembling a team to go into Haiti and urgently take out children, the younger woman's father, Mel Coulter, told the AP from his home in Kuna, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
The group packed 40 plastic bins of donated goods into a U-Haul trailer and drove to Salt Lake City on Jan. 22, where they took a flight to the Dominican Republic. They made their way to Haiti, where four days later, they were introduced to Adrien.
</P>
<P>
Adrien, who had served as the go-between and translator for the missionaries, said he had no knowledge of the group's larger plans; villagers said they were told none of their children would be offered for adoption.
</P>
<P>
A Haitian-born pastor who said he worked as an unpaid consultant for the group insisted the Baptists had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jean Sainvil said some of the children were orphans and might have been put up for adoption. Children with parents were to be kept in the Dominican Republic, and would not lose contact with their families, Sainvil said in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody agreed that they knew where the children were going. The parents were told, and we confirmed they would be allowed to see the children and even take them back if need be," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sainvil stressed that in Haiti it is not uncommon for parents who can't support their children to send them to orphanages.
</P>
<P>
Even Prime Minister Max Bellerive has said he recognized the Americans may simply have been well-meaning who believed their charitable Christian intent justified trying to remove the children from quake-crippled Haiti.
</P>
<P>
Only minutes before the charges, the Americans' Dominican lawyer, Jorge Puello, had said he expected at least nine of the 10 to be released and said he was arranging a charter flight for them from Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital.
</P>
<P>
After the Haitian lawyer's announcement, Puello could not be reached by telephone for comment.
</P>
<P>
"I'm at the airport (in Santo Domingo) and we're getting the plane ready. We're just waiting for the green light," Puello said. "I spoke to a source inside the jail -- a government official -- who said nine would be released but one would be held for further investigation."

No early release for US missionaries in Haiti
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ten U.S. Baptist missionaries charged with child kidnapping returned to jail Friday after failing to persuade a judge to grant them provisional release pending the outcome of their case, their lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
The weary looking Americans were led one by one into the back of a police van after spending half the day at a courthouse in the rubble-strewn capital. A judge scheduled three more days of hearings next week, starting Monday, defense attorney Edwin Coq told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Haitian officials at the court declined to answer questions from journalists about the case. The missionaries did not respond to questions and Coq said they had been ordered by the judge not to discuss their case.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said that at least nine of the Americans -- all but the group's leader, Laura Silsby -- clearly did not know they lacked the proper papers to remove 33 children from Haiti following the devastating earthquake and they should be immediately released.
</P>
<P>
"They came to Haiti to help. They came in solidarity," he said. "It is scandalous that they are being detained."
</P>
<P>
Prior to the closed hearing, Coq told reporters he would ask the judge to grant the detainees "provisional release," a type of bail without money posted. He said they should be allowed to leave Haiti until their trial, a date for which has not been established.
</P>
<P>
An investigating judge charged the Americans on Thursday with kidnapping for trying to take the 33 children across the border into the Dominican Republic on Jan. 29 without documentation.
</P>
<P>
Coq says Silsby knew she couldn't take the youngsters without proper paperwork. But he characterized the other nine missionaries as innocents caught up in actions they didn't understand.
</P>
<P>
The Baptist group, most of whose members are from two Idaho churches, insisted they were rescuing abandoned children and orphans after the Jan. 12 quake.
</P>
<P>
But at least 22 of the children, ranging in age from 2 to 12, have parents. Some of the parents told The Associated Press they gave them up willingly because the missionaries promised the children a better life.
</P>
<P>
Each of the missionaries is charged with one count of kidnapping, which carries a sentence of five to 15 years in prison, and one of criminal association, punishable by three to nine years. Coq said the case was assigned a judge and a verdict could take three months.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously this is a matter for the Haitian judicial system," U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, now a special U.N. envoy to Haiti, met with President Rene Preval in Port-au-Prince on Friday, but said his visit had nothing to do with the detained Americans.
</P>
<P>
Later, Clinton said the U.S. and Haitian governments should try to resolve the issue quickly.
</P>
<P>
"I think what's important now is that the government of Haiti and the government of the United States to get together and go through this because the government of Haiti, as I understand it, is not looking for a fight. They just want to protect children," he said during a visit to an AIDS clinic.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I ask is both sides try to work through it as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Clint Henry, the pastor at Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Idaho, which Silsby and several other detainees attend, also called for Haiti to quickly free the group.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the very best thing that could happen -- not only for our loved ones who we miss dearly, but also for the people of Haiti -- is for their government to release them as quickly as possible, allowing the world's attention to be focused where it should be, on helping a nation that experienced a devastating earthquake," Henry told reporters in Idaho, without taking questions.
</P>
<P>
Three national leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention sent a letter Friday to President Barack Obama urging him to "do everything within the authority of your office to secure a safe return home" for the detainees.
</P>
<P>
The leaders added that they could not "speak authoritatively about the motives and actions" of those detained, saying they went to Haiti on their own and weren't part of the Southern Baptist Convention's international relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
Silsby, who wanted to create an orphanage for Haitian children in the neighboring Dominican Republic, and the other nine went to Haiti after the earthquake to gather children for their project.
</P>
<P>
Most of the children were from the village of Callebas, where people said they handed the kids over because they couldn't feed or clothe them. Their stories contradicted Silsby's account that the children came from collapsed orphanages or were handed over by distant relatives.
</P>
<P>
Silsby also said she believed she had all the necessary documents to take the children. The Dominican consul in Haiti, however, said he warned Silsby her mission would be considered child trafficking if she lacked adoption papers signed by Haitian officials.

Haiti parents testify they gave kids to Americans

<P>
Parents of some of the children who 10 U.S. missionaries tried to take out of Haiti after its catastrophic earthquake told a judge Tuesday that they freely handed over their kids, the Americans' lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
The parents' testimony means no law was broken and "we can't talk any more about trafficking of human beings," attorney Aviol Fleurant told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident the judge will dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the Americans, most from an Idaho church group, have now been interviewed by the judge, who is to decide whether they will stand trial. The judge did not speak with reporters.
</P>
<P>
Flaurent said the Americans would be back in court Wednesday. One of them, Jim Allen of Amarillo, Texas, was represented by a separate lawyer Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Americans were charged with kidnapping and criminal association last week for trying to take 33 children into the neighboring Dominican Republic on Jan. 29 without proper documentation.
</P>
<P>
The Baptist missionaries say they were heading to a Dominican orphanage following Haiti's devastating quake, and had only good intentions.
</P>
<P>
Their leader, Laura Silsby of Meridian, Idaho, told The Associated Press the day after their arrest that the children were obtained from orphanages and distant relatives.
</P>
<P>
However, the parents of some of the children told the AP last week that they turned their youngsters over to the group. The parents said did so willingly after the missionaries promised the kids would be educated and relatives could visit them.
</P>
<P>
Silsby was the only American not to appear in court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer who represented the missionaries until last week said that Silsby deceived the rest of the group about having proper paperwork and that everyone but her should go free.
</P>
<P>
The Americans' original Haitian lawyer was fired late Friday. The Dominican attorney who had hired him claimed the Haitian attempted to bribe the detainees' way out of jail without their knowledge. The Haitian lawyer denied that.

Haiti frees US missionary; group leader still held

<P>
One of two Baptist missionaries still held on kidnapping charges in Haiti was released and flew to Miami on Monday, but the U.S. group's leader remained in custody.
</P>
<P>
Charisa Coulter, 24, was taken from her jail cell to the airport by U.S. Embassy staff more than a month after she and nine other Americans were arrested for trying to take 33 children out of Haiti after the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Coulter, wearing a red tank top and sunglasses, declined comment as she quickly got into an SUV that took her to the Haitian airport, where she caught a flight back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Coulter's father said his daughter arrived in Miami late Monday and went straight to a hotel.
</P>
<P>
Mel Coulter said her release brings a mix of joy and sorrow knowing that the leader of the Idaho-based missionary group, Laura Silsby, will be spending the night all alone in a Haitian jail.
</P>
<P>
"It is good news, but it's tempered," Coulter said. "We're really happy to have our daughter back on American soil. But Laura is still there. So this is really only completing part of the journey for the two of them. My daughter has left her best friend behind."
</P>
<P>
Silsby, 40, said she was glad about Coulter's release.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy that she left today, and for her freedom, and expect mine to come soon," Silsby told The Associated Press as she left the courthouse where a judge held a closed hearing Monday. She was returned to her cell in a police station near Port-au-Prince airport.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Louis Ricardo Chachoute said Coulter was released because there was no evidence to support the charges of kidnapping and criminal association. He predicted Silsby would be released soon as well.
</P>
<P>
"There are no prosecution witnesses to substantiate anything," Chachoute said.
</P>
<P>
Coulter, of Boise, is a diabetic and had medical difficulties during her confinement. She was treated at least once, on Feb. 1, by American doctors after collapsing with what she said was either severe dehydration or the flu.
</P>
<P>
After a court hearing Monday for Silsby, Judge Bernard Saint-Vil said he heard evidence from a police officer who said he stopped Silsby from loading a bus with children near the Dominican Republic consulate in Port-au-Prince on Jan. 26. That was three days before her group was arrested while trying to cross into the Dominican Republic with 33 children.
</P>
<P>
"I found inconsistencies in some of Laura's statements," Saint-Vil told reporters, saying he planned to visit the Dominican consulate to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
The Dominican consul in Haiti, Carlos Castillo, has said previously that he warned Silsby she lacked the required papers to leave the country with the children and risked being arrested at the border for child trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The Americans' arrest came as Haitian authorities were trying to crack down on unauthorized adoptions to prevent child trafficking in the chaos following the catastrophic Jan. 12 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Silsby initially said the children were orphaned in the quake that the government said has killed more than 230,000 people. But the AP found the children had been given away by still-living parents.
</P>
<P>
Chachoute said the Americans only came to Haiti to help the country. "Firstly, there was no criminal conspiracy; secondly, there was no child snatching," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Baptist group planned to take the children to the neighboring Dominican Republic to an orphanage that Silsby was creating in a former hotel.
</P>
<P>
The judge released eight of the Americans on Feb. 17 after concluding parents voluntarily gave up their children in the belief that the Baptist group would give them a better life. But he decided he still had additional questions for Silsby and Coulter.

Halliburton, KBR drop court appeal in rape case
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOUSTON 2010-03-22 22:12:58 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Halliburton Co. and KBR Inc. have withdrawn an appeal asking the U.S. Supreme Court to block a lawsuit by a former military contractor who says she was raped by KBR co-workers in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
KBR said in a statement Monday that it withdrew the appeal to not risk violating a recently passed federal provision it called "very broad and vague," that restricts the Defense Department from doing business with companies that prohibit employees from seeking redress for certain crimes through the courts.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, KBR did not want to risk being in violation of the amendment, so the company withdrew its petition," KBR said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Diana Gabriel, a spokeswoman for Halliburton, also confirmed the appeal was withdrawn but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Jamie Leigh Jones, of Texas, sued the companies after she says she was raped while working for KBR in Baghdad in 2005. KBR and Halliburton split in 2007.
</P>
<P>
The companies argued that Jones' contract required claims against them be settled through arbitration.
</P>
<P>
But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans sided with Jones in September, saying her case could go to trial.
</P>
<P>
A trial date has been set for May 2011, Jones' attorney Todd Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
Now that the Supreme Court appeal has been withdrawn, "it looks like we're headed for trial," said Kelly, who is based in Houston.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press usually doesn't name people alleging sexual assault, but Jones' identity has been broadcast in media reports and on her own Web site.
</P>
<P>
No one has been charged in Jones' case or in any other alleged sexual assaults on women who did civilian work in Iraq. At least three women have testified before Congress about being sexually assaulted or harassed while working as military contractors in Iraq.

Crash investigators search for clues in Libya

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dutch and American crash investigators helped search for clues Sunday in the debris field of the airliner that slammed into the desert short of an airport runway in Libya's capital last week.
</P>
<P>
Libyan authorities, meanwhile, determined that one of those found dead among the shattered wreckage was not a passenger but a Libyan airport worker who responded to the scene and died of a heart attack. The new information, however, did not alter the official casualty count from Wednesday's crash.
</P>
<P>
All but one of the 104 people on board the flight from South Africa to the Libyan capital died. The sole survivor, 9-year-old Ruben van Assouw of the Netherlands, returned home Saturday without his parents and 11-year-old brother, who perished in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Most of those on board the Afriqiyah Airways jetliner were Dutch tourists.
</P>
<P>
Lead Dutch investigator Daan Noort said Sunday that the difficult work of identifying bodies has started after relatives supplied DNA samples and other information to aid the process. He said the crash left some of the victims' bodies in pieces.
</P>
<P>
"Some are whole bodies. Some are just parts," Noort said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Rahman al-Amin, the airport worker who responded to the crash and collapsed amid the wreckage, was diabetic and had high blood pressure, said his cousin Abdul-Razzaq Bu Abdullah. He was taken to a hospital but could not be revived.
</P>
<P>
Experts from France and South Africa also helping to determine the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team includes officials from the National Transportation Safety Board, technical advisers from the Federal Aviation Administration and representatives of U.S. manufacturer General Electric, which made the plane's engines.
</P>
<P>
The plane's black boxes -- the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder -- were recovered intact and have been sent to Paris for review.
</P>
<P>
Naji Dhou, the head of the Libyan committee investigating the crash, told reporters Saturday that preliminary results indicate the plane had diverted about 4 degrees from the runway and landed about 400 yards in front of it.
</P>
<P>
He said debris from the crash was scattered over a more than 8,000-square-foot (800-square-meter) area, but investigators had only covered a small fraction of that so far.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no explosion until the plane hit the ground. Libya has ruled out terrorism as a possible cause of the crash, although the investigation is still under way.

US, Cuba to hold migration talks next week
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HAVANA 2010-06-12 23:49:33 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States and Cuba have agreed to hold immigration talks in Washington within days, a U.S. official said Saturday, the first since a similar meeting in Havana in February.
</P>
<P>
The talks scheduled for Friday are intended to monitor adherence to a 16-year-old agreement under which the United States issues 20,000 visas to Cubans a year, though in the past the sides have used the meeting to delve into more contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
In the last round of talks, U.S. diplomats pressed Cuba to release Alan Gross, a jailed American contractor that Cuba has accused of spying. Gross has been jailed for more than 6 months without charge.
</P>
<P>
The American delegation also met with dissidents in Havana, raising the ire of Cuban officials.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of talks will take place at an as-yet undetermined location in Washington, Gloria Berbena, a spokeswoman for the U.S Interests Section in Havana, told The Associated Press. The U.S. maintains the Interests Section instead of an embassy.
</P>
<P>
After a brief period of hope that U.S. President Barack Obama would usher in a new era of rapprochement with America's longtime Caribbean foe, relations between the United States and Cuba have been on a downward trajectory for some months.
</P>
<P>
Fidel Castro, once a grudging admirer of the president, has been harshly critical lately of everything from Obama's work at global climate change talks, to America's backing of Israel, to the use of American soldiers as part of relief efforts in quake-ravaged Haiti.
</P>
<P>
Cuba was particularly angry when Washington included the island on a list of state sponsors of terrorism back in December.
</P>
<P>
For its part, U.S. officials have made clear that there is little hope for improved relations while Cuba holds Gross. They have also continued to call on Fidel and his brother, President Raul Castro, to open up the island's political system to democratic reform. Cuba insists that the U.S. drop its 48-year trade embargo and stop meddling in the island's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Despite the lukewarm relations, there have been far more contacts between U.S. and Cuban officials than in years past. The State Department confirmed bilateral talks a few weeks ago on how to respond to the Gulf oil spill, which could threaten Cuban shores.

<P>
Forecasters say Hurricane Earl is weakening as it passes over North Carolina's Outer Banks but is still packing powerful winds as it heads up the Eastern Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
The National Hurricane Center says Earl's winds are now at about 105 mph (168 kph). A new tropical storm warning has been issued for New England from the coasts of Massachusetts to Maine.
</P>
<P>
Gusts above 40 mph (64 kph) made signs shake and the heavy rain fall sideways in Buxton, the southeasternmost tip of the Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
North Carolina is the first and potentially most destructive stop on the storm's projected journey up the Eastern Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
Earl's eye is some 100 miles (160 kilometers) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras but isn't expected to make landfall until perhaps western Nova Scotia, Canada, in the next few days.

US chef featured on TV cooking show kills himself
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TRENTON, New Jersey 2010-09-28 18:34:10 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chef who described "overwhelming" personal debt when he was featured on Gordon Ramsay's "Kitchen Nightmares" show jumped to his death from a bridge.
</P>
<P>
The body of 39-year-old Joseph Cerniglia was found floating in the Hudson River on Friday. Grace Burgess, a spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner's office, said the office on Tuesday ruled Cerniglia's death a suicide. Authorities said he jumped from the George Washington Bridge, which connects New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Cerniglia owned Campania in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, which he bought in 2006. In 2007, the debt-ridden Italian restaurant was featured on Ramsay's show.
</P>
<P>
During the broadcast, Cerniglia estimated he owed purveyors about $80,000.
</P>
<P>
"I'm financially in trouble. The debt of the restaurant alone is overwhelming," he said. "My personal debt -- wife, kids, mortgage -- that's a lot of debt."
</P>
<P>
His wife added, "If this business fails, we will lose everything."
</P>
<P>
"Why did you become a chef-owner if you haven't a clue how to run a business?" Ramsay asks him on the show.
</P>
<P>
A self-taught chef, Cerniglia worked for the famed New York-based Gallagher's Steakhouse chain for a decade, where he became the executive chef.
</P>
<P>
Jim Edwards, the culinary director at Chef Central in Paramus, was a close friend for the last seven years. He last saw Cerniglia three weeks ago and said he seemed his cheerful self.
</P>
<P>
"He never gave the outward appearance that there was anything bothering him," Edwards said. "He was always very creative and upbeat. He had a very infectious smile and a way of making you feel at home.
</P>
<P>
"It's very tragic, whatever it was he couldn't overcome," Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
Edwards said his friend benefited from being on Ramsay's show and said he thought it portrayed him in a favorable light overall.
</P>
<P>
"I thought he fared well," Edwards said. "I was never at the restaurant when it wasn't packed."
</P>
<P>
Cerniglia is the second former contestant on a Ramsay television show to commit suicide. The other was a former contestant on the British celebrity chef's "Hell's Kitchen" chef competition.
</P>
<P>
Calls and e-mails sent to Ramsay's publicist in London were not immediately returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cerniglia leaves behind his wife and three sons, ages 13, 11 and 9.
</P>
<P>
The family is holding a private funeral service on Wednesday for Cerniglia in Wayne, where he grew up. Relatives declined to talk about him Tuesday when reached by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
In his obituary, his family spoke positively about the show: "He was honored to have his restaurant featured on an episode of 'Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares' and the television experience was thrilling for him."

New book gives intimate portrait of convicted Knox
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROME 2010-10-17 11:28:04 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amanda Knox, the American student convicted in Italy of murdering her British roommate, is quoted as saying in a new book that she'd rather not be famous for the slaying and that her days in jail feel like "limbo" -- suspended between her old life and her hopes for the future.
</P>
<P>
Knox talks about her aspirations to marry and adopt children, and her interests in writing and studying languages in a series of jailhouse conversations with an Italian lawmaker who visited her over the past year. The conversations serve as the basis for the book.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Knox was convicted in December of murder and sexual assault in the 2007 death of her housemate, British student Meredith Kercher. She was sentenced to 26 years in prison by a court in Perugia, central Italy.
</P>
<P>
Knox's former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito of Italy, was convicted alongside Knox and sentenced to 25 years in prison. A third man, Rudy Hermann Guede, an Ivory Coast citizen, was convicted in a separate, earlier trial and sentenced to 30 years in prison -- which was cut to 16 years on appeal.
</P>
<P>
All three have maintained their innocence.
</P>
<P>
The book "Take Me With You - Talks with Amanda Knox in Prison" by lawmaker Rocco Girlanda comes out Tuesday, about a month before Knox's appeal begins Nov. 24. A lawyer for the Kercher family called it "inappropriate" and unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly don't feel there was a need for this book," Kercher family attorney Francesco Maresca said.
</P>
<P>
The book is one of many on a case that has fascinated audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. But unlike the others, it does not discuss Kercher's murder.
</P>
<P>
Knox is quoted as mentioning Kercher's name only once -- to say on the day of the discovery of "Meredith's case" she was supposed to go on a trip to a nearby town with Sollecito.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the book focuses on Knox's personality, her childhood in Seattle, her hopes for post-prison life. The conversations range from mundane topics -- movies and bike-riding -- to wider subjects -- literature and religion -- and even touch on the possibility of alien life in the universe.
</P>
<P>
The book is being published in Italian and as an e-book in English by Piemme, a publishing house within the Mondadori media empire. The Associated Press was given an advance copy exclusively among international media.
</P>
<P>
Knox says she would like to get married but "must also find the person," and would adopt children rather than giving birth because "there are a lot of kids in this world who have no one."
</P>
<P>
She speaks of the letters she received in jail, including marriage proposals.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody tells me, 'You're famous.' And I answer, 'I'm not Angelina Jolie!'" she is quoted as saying. "How ugly to be famous for this. I would have preferred to be (famous) for something I built, I achieved."
</P>
<P>
At another point, Knox says "being in here is like being in a limbo."
</P>
<P>
"You live a little bit between the memory of life the way it was before, your hopes for tomorrow -- and trying as hard as you can not to feel like you're in here," she says.
</P>
<P>
Girlanda says he kept diaries of the some 20 Italian-language conversations he has had with Knox since her conviction. Girlanda, who heads a foundation that promotes ties between Italy and the United States, said he started meeting with Knox in a bid to help offset the diplomatic fallout the explosive case had created.
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker said he was curious to know the person behind the public persona, and never talked to Knox's parents, friends or lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to know Amanda, I wasn't interested in Amanda Knox," Girlanda told the AP. He insisted the girl he had come to know was different from the "sex, drugs and rock and roll" image depicted by some in the press.
</P>
<P>
Knox was described by the prosecution as a manipulative, cold-blooded she-devil who had grown apart from Kercher. Knox insisted she was friends with the victim and was shocked by her death.
</P>
<P>
The attorney for the Kercher family, Maresca, said he had not read the book but understood the author was trying to portray Knox as a profound, smart girl who as such could not possibly have been guilty.
</P>
<P>
But Maresca maintained that conversations which took place years after the crime aren't necessarily indicative of a person's true character.
</P>
<P>
"Three years of prison -- and three years in a life in general -- can change a person," Maresca said. "People can appear different from what they really are -- or can even genuinely have changed."
</P>
<P>
Kercher's body was found in a pool of blood with her throat slit on Nov. 2, 2007, in the bedroom of the house she shared with Knox while the two were exchange students in Perugia. Knox and Sollecito were arrested a few days later.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say on the night of the murder, Knox and Sollecito met at the apartment and Guede was also there. The prosecution said Knox and Kercher started arguing, and Knox joined the two men in brutally attacking and sexually assaulting the Briton while being under the influence of drugs.
</P>
<P>
Maresca has called the long prison sentences fair, saying they had satisfied Kercher's bereaved family.

US, Cuban diplos met about jailed US man
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HAVANA 2010-10-18 19:14:56 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington's top diplomat for the Americas had a rare face-to-face meeting with Cuba's foreign minister to discuss the fate of an American jailed in Cuba for nearly 11 months on suspicion of spying, the State Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary of State Arturo Valenzuela met Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Sept. 24 on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. The meeting is thought to be among the highest-level diplomatic encounters between the two Cold War enemies since President Obama took office in 2008.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting was to encourage the release of Alan Gross," State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said. "Unfortunately, that has not yet happened."
</P>
<P>
Crowley confirmed the meeting after The Associated Press broke news of the encounter, citing two State Department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
Gross, a 60-year-old native of Potomac, Maryland, was working for a firm contracted by USAID when he was arrested Dec. 3, 2009, and sent to Cuba's high-security Villa Marista prison. He has not been charged, but senior Cuban leaders including President Raul Castro have accused him of spying.
</P>
<P>
In a potential sign of progress, Cuba allowed Gross's wife, Judy, to visit him for the first time in August. U.S. diplomats insist Gross was not doing anything wrong, and have said his continued detention makes it difficult to improve relations.
</P>
<P>
Crowley said Washington continues to work toward Gross's release.
</P>
<P>
"We would hope that it happened today, but that is up to the Cuban government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and the United States have been at odds since shortly after Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution. The U.S. has maintained an economic embargo on the island for 48 years.
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official described the meeting between Valenzuela and Rodriguez as brief and "cordial." He said there were no major developments in the case, or significant discussions on other matters.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Cuba and the United States have improved little in recent years, despite hope by some that Obama's election would open a new chapter. But diplomatic contact between the two sides has increased after being nearly nonexistent under President George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Mills, chief of staff to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, met with Rodriguez in March on the sidelines of a U.N. conference on Haiti to discuss the Gross case. While Mills is close to the secretary of state, her position is not considered to be part of the diplomatic chain of command, making Valenzuela's encounter with the Cuban foreign minister more senior.
</P>
<P>
As assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Valenzuela is the senior U.S. diplomat for the Americas. Craig Kelly, a former deputy assistant secretary of state, came to Cuba in February for immigration talks -- and also raised the Gross case.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also discussed restarting direct mail service.

American Ballet Theatre comes to Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HAVANA 2010-11-02 19:14:21 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Ballet Theatre dancers promised pirouettes -- not politics -- during the troupe's historic visit to Cuba this week, the first by the New York-based company since shortly after Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution turned the island into a U.S. nemesis.
</P>
<P>
America's premier ballet company was in Havana to pay homage to Cuba's most famous ballerina, 89-year-old Alicia Alonso, who danced with the American Ballet Theatre in the 1940s and 50s before returning to her homeland to found Cuba's National Ballet.
</P>
<P>
The trip is part of a surge in feel-good cultural and artistic exchanges since President Barack Obama took office in 2008, though political headway between the Cold War foes has been harder to come by.
</P>
<P>
Kevin McKenzie, artistic director of the U.S. ballet company, said the dancers were here as artists, not politicians -- but that he hoped such cultural exchanges could help improve understanding across the Straits of Florida.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to say what political impact our presence here will have, because we are not politicians," he said at a press conference kicking off the trip on Tuesday. "It is not our purpose here to do anything but speak of our cultural sameness. I think it is that dialogue that will expand to brighter and more positive horizons in the future."
</P>
<P>
Alonso, who has been nearly blind for decades, continued to dance into her 70s and remains one of the most recognized prima ballerinas in the world.
</P>
<P>
Julie Kent, one of the company's best-known ballerinas, said it was a particular thrill to perform in front of the legendary dancer herself.
</P>
<P>
"She set such a standard at American Ballet Theater that it is one of the reasons that it is such a great company," she said. "We all feel very much that we are her grandchildren, just as the dancers in the National Ballet de Cuba are."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dancers will perform scenes from "Siete Sonatas," "Fancy Free" and "Theme and Variations" -- a ballet written by George Balanchine in 1947 specifically with Alonso in mind -- during performances Wednesday and Thursday at Havana's 5,500-seat Karl Marx theater.
</P>
<P>
They are one of a host of renowned ballet troupes from around the world who have traveled to Cuba for the 22nd International Ballet Festival of Havana, called this year in honor of Alonso's 90th birthday, which will take place Dec. 21. Dancers from the New York City Ballet were also taking part in the festival.
</P>
<P>
The American Ballet Theater troupe includes two Cuban-American dancers, Jose Manuel Carreno and Xiomara Reyes. Reyes, a prima ballerina, is making her first visit to Cuba since leaving the island as an 18 year old in 1992.
</P>
<P>
She told The Associated Press she has not slept well for weeks in anticipation of her return -- a mix of excitement and nervousness at seeing old friends and performing before her own people. She said she was struck both by Havana's beauty -- and the extent to which its buildings have crumbled since she left.
</P>
<P>
"I am filled with so many emotions: sadness, joy, everything," she said. "To be here and see people you haven't seen in 18 years. It is very beautiful to see that the people remember you."
</P>
<P>
Reyes said later at the press conference that she felt as if she were on "an emotional roller coaster."
</P>
<P>
"It is not just returning to Cuba after 18 years and seeing the public that witnessed the beginning of my career, which touches me deeply," she said, her eyes filled with emotion. "It is also the fact that I bring my company with me, a company which has not been here for 50 years, and which has been so important to Cuban ballet."
</P>
<P>
The last time American Ballet Theater was in Cuba was in April 1960, for the first Havana festival.
</P>
<P>
Cultural exchanges have been few and far between in recent years, particularly during the administration of President George W. Bush, who cut the number of visas given to Cuban artists and toughened travel restrictions for Americans hoping to visit the island.
</P>
<P>
That has changed under Obama. The ballet company's trip comes on the heels of a similar visit last month by famed American trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center orchestra. Several Cuban musicians -- including Silvio Rodriguez, Omara Portuondo and Chucho Valdes -- have toured the United States in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The cultural exchanges have so far not been accompanied by any meaningful thaw in relations. The U.S. has maintained a 48-year trade embargo on Cuba, and has demanded political and economic openings before it lifts the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Cuban leaders say the embargo is cruel, and that America has no business telling them what kind of government they should have.
</P>
<P>
President Raul Castro has in recent months instituted sweeping economic changes designed to inject a measure of capitalism into Cuba's tottering socialist economy. His government has also released most of the 52 prisoners of conscience it still held in jail from a 2003 sweep.
</P>
<P>
The changes have been met with lukewarm approval in Washington, where officials have said they would like to see evidence of more concrete action.
</P>
<P>
Cuba continues to hold an American subcontractor, Alan Gross, on suspicion of spying. U.S. officials have said his release is crucial before any significant political progress can be made.
</P>
<P>
Heriberto Cabezas, one of the ballet festival's main organizer, said he hoped more American companies would participate in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The fact we have not had American ballet companies here in the last 10 years is not because we didn't want them," he said, referring to the difficulty in obtaining U.S. government permission. "We are in a new era and we hope it lasts a long time."

Mexico police arrest 8 in death of ex-AG ' s brother
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MEXICO CITY 2010-11-05 15:15:25 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight members of a drug cartel were arrested in the torture and slaying of the brother of a former Mexican state attorney general, federal police announced Friday. The man had been forced to appear at gunpoint in a video saying his sister worked for a rival gang.
</P>
<P>
The body of Mario Gonzalez was found half buried in a house under construction in Chihuahua city after one of the suspects told officials where they could find him, federal police commissioner Facundo Rosas told a news conference. He said the body showed signs of torture.
</P>
<P>
The suspect said a man known as "The Vulture" ordered the group to kidnap Mario Angel Gonzalez Rodriguez, Rosas said. The men are suspected of working for the Sinaloa cartel.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, an attorney, was kidnapped from his office on Oct. 21 -- less than three weeks after his sister Patricia Gonzalez stepped down as Chihuahua state's attorney general due to a change of governor.
</P>
<P>
Days after the kidnapping, a video was posted on YouTube showing Gonzalez handcuffed and surrounded by five masked men pointing guns at him. Prodded by an interrogator, he blamed his sister for several notorious killings in the state and said both he and she had aided the "La Linea" drug gang.
</P>
<P>
Rosas said some of the men arrested had appeared in the video, which he said was shot as a safe house for the Sinaloa cartel.
</P>
<P>
Cartels have increasingly taken to releasing video clips of kidnapped police, officials and regular citizens admitting to crimes that aided rivals of the kidnappers. In several cases, the subject of the video has been found dead shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
Federal police paraded the suspects -- some with bruised faces -- before television cameras on Friday. The announcement of the arrests came a day after the federal Attorney General's Office said it was opening and investigation into the case.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was attorney general during the most violent peacetime period in the history of Chihuahua state. A nearly three-year-old turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa drug cartels has made Chihuahua the deadliest state in Mexico, and the border city of Ciudad Juarez one of the world's most dangerous cities.
</P>
<P>
In the video, the questioner prompted Mario Gonzalez into saying that his sister ordered several killings in Ciudad Juarez, where drug-gang violence has claimed more than 6,500 lives over the past three years. Among those, he said, was the 2008 killing of Armando Rodriguez, a crime reporter for the newspaper El Diario de Juarez.

Reputed drug kingpin killed in Mexico shootout
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MEXICO CITY 2010-11-06 03:34:32 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican security forces killed reputed Gulf cartel leader Antonio Ezequiel Cardenas Guillen, one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords, in a spectacular, hours-long gunbattle Friday in the northern border city of Matamoros.
</P>
<P>
Cardenas Guillen, also known as "Tony Tormenta" or "Tony the Storm," is the brother of imprisoned former leader Osiel Cardenas Guillen and is believed to have run the powerful cartel along with Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
He is the latest in a growing number of high-profile cartel leaders who have been captured or killed by the armed forces since President Felipe Calderon stationed them across the country to battle drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The clashes across the border from Brownsville, Texas, also claimed the lives of three gunmen and two marines, said Alejandro Poire, Calderon's security spokesman. A soldier and a local reporter were also killed, the Mexican Defense Department said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
Gunfire first broke out about 11 a.m. at an upscale residential area in Matamoros and shootouts ensued throughout the city after that for about eight hours, said a resident who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal.
</P>
<P>
A video posted on YouTube shows a string of SUVs and pickup trucks racing through a street while continuous shooting is heard in the background. Men wearing ski masks get out of a car and use it to block the street.
</P>
<P>
Cardenas Guillen, 48, had been indicted in the United States on drug-trafficking charges and U.S. authorities had offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest. Mexican authorities offered a $2 million reward and had him on their list of the nation's most wanted drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
His death is a blow to Mexico's second-most powerful cartel and a major boost to Calderon's war on drug cartels. Mexico's Sinaloa cartel is considered Mexico's largest drug cartel. U.S. authorities consider Cardenas Guillen a key trafficker of cocaine and marijuana into the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we have taken another meaningful step toward the dismantling of criminal groups that do so much damage to our country," Poire said.
</P>
<P>
The deceased trafficker's brother Osiel Cardenas Guillen led the Gulf cartel until his arrest by Mexican authorities in 2003. Osiel was extradited to the United States in 2007 and sentenced to 25 years in prison by a Texas court in February.
</P>
<P>
Northeastern Mexico, an area once controlled by the Gulf cartel, has seen an increase in violence due to a turf battle between the cartel and the Zetas, a drug gang made up of former Mexican special-forces soldiers. The violence has included broad-daylight shootouts and dozens of beheaded corpses dumped in public areas.
</P>
<P>
The Matamoros newspaper El Expreso said on its website that reporter Carlos Guajardo was covering the shootout when he was struck. Local news media reported Guajardo was leaving the area of the clash when his car was hit by gunfire more than 20 times.
</P>
<P>
The Committee to Protect Journalists said in a recent report that at least 22 Mexican journalists have been killed since December 2006, when Calderon launched his crackdown on the cartels. Nationwide, more than 28,000 people have been killed in drug violence.
</P>
<P>
The death of Cardenas Guillen is the latest blow to drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Arturo Beltran Leyva, leader of the Beltran Leyva cartel, died in a raid outside Mexico City on Dec. 16, 2009. Mexican soldiers killed the Sinaloa cartel's No. 3 capo, Ignacio "Nacho" Coronel, on July 29 of this year. On Aug. 30, federal police announced the capture of Edgar Valdez Villarreal, alias "La Barbie," and on Sept. 12 Mexican marines captured Sergio Villarreal Barragan, another presumed Beltran Leyva leader.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Mexican authorities announced that eight members of a drug cartel were arrested in the torture and slaying of the brother of a former state attorney general. The man had been forced to appear at gunpoint in a video saying his sister worked for a rival gang.
</P>
<P>
The body of Mario Angel Gonzalez Rodriguez was found half buried in a house under construction in Chihuahua city after one of the suspects told officials where they could find him, Federal Police Commissioner Facundo Rosas told a news conference. He said the body showed signs of torture.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, an attorney, was kidnapped from his office Oct. 21 -- less than three weeks after his sister Patricia Gonzalez stepped down as Chihuahua state's attorney general due to a change of governor.
</P>
<P>
Days after the kidnapping, a video was posted on YouTube showing Gonzalez handcuffed and surrounded by five masked men pointing guns at him. Prodded by an interrogator, he blamed his sister for several notorious killings in the state and said both he and she had aided "La Linea," a drug gang tied to the Juarez cartel.
</P>
<P>
Rosas said some of the men arrested had appeared in the video, which he said was shot at a safe house for the Sinaloa cartel.
</P>
<P>
Cartels have increasingly taken to releasing video clips of abducted police, officials and regular citizens admitting to crimes that aided rivals of the kidnappers. In several cases, the subject of the video has been found dead shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was attorney general during the most violent peacetime period in the history of Chihuahua state. A nearly 3-year-old turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa drug cartels has made Chihuahua the deadliest state in Mexico, and Ciudad Juarez, on the border, one of the world's most dangerous cities.
</P>
<P>
In the video, the questioner prompted Mario Gonzalez into saying that his sister ordered several killings in Ciudad Juarez, where drug-gang violence has claimed more than 6,500 lives over the past three years. Among those, he said, was the 2008 killing of Armando Rodriguez, a crime reporter for the newspaper El Diario de Juarez.
</P>
<P>
Rosas said one of the suspects told police that Gonzalez was beaten on his feet and ankles before the video was made. The suspect also said Gonzalez was reading from a script prepared by his captors when he named state police officers and government officials supposedly in the pay of La Linea, Rosas said.
</P>
<P>
More than 28,000 Mexicans have been killed in drug-related violence since Calderon launched a national assault on organized crime in late 2006.

She was half the age of Norman Mailer when they met and their bond was as fast and fateful as a mortal's coupling with a god.
</P>
<P>
Norris Church Mailer, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author's sixth and final wife, would enjoy and endure the ride of her life.
</P>
<P>
An actress, Wilhemina model, author and painter, Mailer died at her home in Brooklyn on Sunday. She was 61. Her passing was announced on the website of the Norman Mailer Society, which in a statement said she passed away "after a long and valiant struggle with cancer." A longtime family friend and assistant, Dwayne Raymond, said he and her two children and some close friends were at her home when she died.

As Norris Mailer wrote in her 2010 memoir, "A Ticket to the Circus," she was a single mother in her mid-20s when she met the then-52-year-old Norman Mailer at a 1975 cocktail party in his honor in Russellville, Arkansas. Their attraction was immediate, even if he was breaking up with his fourth wife and seeing the woman who would become his fifth. Norris Church became No. 6 in 1980. A son, John Buffalo, had been born two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The new Mrs. Mailer discovered the consequences of fame. The macho Norman Mailer was charming, callous, wise and infuriating. Through her husband, Norris met Jacqueline Kennedy and Imelda Marcos, Woody Allen and Fidel Castro. Norman Mailer could talk about anything; she likened their banter to the rapport between Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. A sign of destiny: The Mailers both were born on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
But even as the author publicly rhapsodized over her auburn-haired beauty, he discouraged his wife's work, avoided her when he learned she had cancer and had affairs with several women, some of whom were referenced in his books and even showed up at social functions, at his invitation.
</P>
<P>
The tension became public by the early 1990s through gossip columns and in an ABC television interview when she told newsman Sam Donaldson that "one day Norman is a lion, the next day he's a monkey. Occasionally he's a lamb, and a large part of the time he's a jackass."
</P>
<P>
They drifted. She threatened to leave. He resisted. She stayed.
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was going to be with him for the rest of my life, and I think he felt the same way," she wrote. When the author died, in 2007, she was at his side and remembered his final moments: "His mouth spread in a huge smile, and his eyes were alive with excitement, as if he were seeing something amazing. Then he was gone."
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Schiller, a family friend who collaborated on Norman Mailer's classic "The Executioner's Song" and other books, said she surprised everyone by becoming such a strong force in his life.
</P>
<P>
"She really took over his life and gave him more time to write," he said. "And she really brought the family together. She showed his (seven) children from his other marriages what kind of father he could be.
</P>
<P>
"She stood up to him and she made him a better man."
</P>
<P>
A road worker's daughter raised in Little Rock and Atkins, Arkansas, she was born Barbara Jean Davis (a name not unlike Norma Jean Baker, the real name of Marilyn Monroe, subject of the only Norman Mailer book she had read when they met), and by age 3 had won a contest as Miss Little Rock. Popular in high school ("I was at the center of everything"), she attended Arkansas Polytechnic College and dated a childhood acquaintance, Larry Norris.
</P>
<P>
They married in 1969, and had a son, Matthew, two years later. But, as she recalled, they were too different -- he preferring solitude, she preferring company. They divorced in 1974. As she began a modeling career, she changed her name to Norris Church, the last name suggested by Mailer because she attended church often as a child.
</P>
<P>
Tall and long-legged, the newly single Church enjoyed "a string of boyfriends," including Bill Clinton, then a candidate for Congress. He had a well-stocked staff of female admirers, she wrote, but clearly favored a plainly dressed blonde named Hillary Rodham who "had an intelligence none of the prettier girls in the room had."
</P>
<P>
"I would have so liked to be able to talk to him about world affairs and politics, or art or literature, or anything, frankly," Mailer wrote. "But we frankly never talked much."
</P>
<P>
Norris Mailer never considered herself in Norman Mailer's class as an author, but she did have a broad interest in the arts. Her paintings were featured in several one-woman shows. She was a member of the Actors Studio, appeared in the television adaptation of Mailer's classic "The Executioner's Song" and had a brief part, with her husband, in the film version of "Ragtime." She also wrote two novels, "Windchill Summer" and "Cheap Diamonds."
</P>
<P>
"I'd had a career. Family. I once had ambitions and dreams that had nothing to do with Norman Mailer," she wrote. "Norman changed my life and the ripples from that first meeting in Arkansas have spread through many others. I wouldn't trade with anybody in the world. And who knows what he's doing on the other side? I'm curious to catch up with him and find out."

A government minister investigating the case of a Pakistani Christian woman sentenced to death for blasphemy against Islam says he believes she is innocent.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti said Monday he is confident Pakistan's president will pardon Asia Bibi because she was falsely accused.
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old was sentenced Nov. 8 to hang for insulting the Prophet Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
The mother of five has spent 1 1/2 years in prison.
</P>

Bibi says the case is the result of a personal dispute with some Muslim women over whether they could share the same water bowl.
</P>
<P>
President Asif Ali Zardari has asked Bhatti to submit a review of the case
</P>

Around 250 hard-line Muslims staged a demonstration in the central Pakistani city of Lahore on Wednesday, warning the president not to pardon a Christian woman sentenced to death for insulting Islam.
</P>
<P>
They also denounced any attempt to change Pakistan's blasphemy law, which critics say is often misused to persecute Christians like Asia Bibi and other minorities. Her case has prompted outrage from human rights groups and a personal appeal from Pope Benedict XVI for her release.
</P>
<P>
But hard-line Islamic groups in Pakistan have pushed back and some have even threatened officials in the past who suggested reforming or repealing the blasphemy law. These groups have significant power since politicians from the major parties rely on them for votes.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to sacrifice our life for the Prophet Muhammad," chanted protesters in Lahore -- many of whom were students from Islamic seminaries in the city.
</P>
<P>
The rally was organized by the Movement for Protection of the Prophet's Honor, a group of hard-line Sunni Muslims that was formed in 2001 to oppose changes in the blasphemy law.
</P>
<P>
Bibi, a 45-year-old mother of five, has said she was falsely accused by a group of Muslim women angry at a dispute over whether they could share the same water bowl. She has been jailed in the eastern province of Punjab since her initial arrest 1 1/2 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A court sentenced her Nov. 8 to hang after convicting her of insulting the prophet.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time a woman has been condemned to death under Pakistan's blasphemy law, often criticized as being abused to inflame religious extremism and settle personal grudges.
</P>
<P>
Her lawyer has filed an appeal with a higher court in Lahore, but she could also be pardoned by the president.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has asked for a review of the facts of the case, raising the possibility of a presidential pardon.
</P>
<P>
One of the strongest defenders of Bibi has been Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, where Lahore is the capital. Wednesday's protest took place in front of the governor's office and the demonstrators railed against him and others calling for Bibi's release.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to tell them that we will not let it happen," said Masoodur Rehman, one of the leaders of the group that organized the rally. "Only the court should decide her fate."
</P>
<P>
Minister for Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti, who is preparing the report for Zardari on the case, said Wednesday that he would deliver his recommendations on Thursday. Bhatti has said he is convinced Bibi is innocent.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Christians, who make up less than 5 percent of the Muslim-majority country's 175 million people, are frequently the targets of accusers invoking the blasphemy law.
</P>
<P>
Bhatti says "dozens" of people -- both Muslims and minorities -- are sentenced to death under the law each year, although higher courts in each case have prevented any executions.
</P>
<P>
Those accused of blasphemy also are often targeted with violence.
</P>
<P>
In July, two Christian brothers accused of blasphemy were gunned down as they left court hearing in Punjab's eastern city of Faislabad.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a 19-year-old Christian accused of desecrating a Quran, Islam's holy book, was found dead in his jail cell in Sialkot, another town in Punjab. Officials said at the time that he had hanged himself, but Christian groups said he was murdered.
</P>
<P>
Bhatti has long campaigned against the blasphemy law, which was introduced by President Gen. Zia ul-Haq's military regime in the 1980s to win the support of hard-line religious groups. Hard-line Islamic groups threatened to behead Bhatti six months ago when he proposed changes to the law.
</P>
<P>
Bhatti said the government is considering calling a meeting of Islamic leaders, politicians, human rights organizations and representatives of minority groups to determine whether the law should be repealed or changed. He said he is dedicated to the effort despite danger to himself.
</P>
<P>
"I am not afraid of these threats," said Bhatti. "I am ready to sacrifice everything for the justice that I believe in."

Bibi's husband, Ashiq Masih, said the family left their village after her arrest and his children haven't been to school in more than a year.

</P>
<P>
"We are in great danger," he said.

No quick pardon for condemned Pakistani Christian

<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistan's president will not immediately pardon a Christian woman sentenced to die for insulting Islam but may do so later if an appeals court delays her case too long, an official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The case against Asia Bibi has inflamed religious passions in Pakistan. Hard-line Muslims demonstrated again Thursday against any pardon for her, and minority Christians held their own protests calling for abolishment of the blasphemy law, which critics say is misused by some to settle personal scores and persecute minorities.
</P>
<P>
Pope Benedict XVI has appealed for the release of Bibi, a 45-year-old mother of five who has said she was wrongly accused by a group of Muslim women with a grudge against her. The pope said her case highlights the persecution of Pakistani Christians, who make up less than 5 percent of the country's 175 million people.
</P>
<P>
Bibi, 45, is the first woman condemned to die under the blasphemy law. She has been jailed for 18 months and was sentenced Nov. 8 to hang for insulting Islam's Prophet Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Her lawyer has filed an appeal with the Lahore High Court, and President Asif Ali Zardari has decided to let the appeal process play out instead of immediately pardoning her, said Minister for Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti, who met with Zardari on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pardoning Bibi would carry political risk for Zardari, whose broadly secular ruling party relies on the support of Islamist groupings in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the president agreed to pardon Bibi later if the appeal case is unduly delayed, said Bhatti, who delivered a report to the president Thursday recommending Bibi be immediately freed. Zardari's spokesman could not be reached Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bhatti said Zardari did not specify any deadline but he believes the president "will not wait months or weeks."
</P>
<P>
About 100 Muslim demonstrators rallied Thursday in the central city of Multan, warning against any presidential pardon for Bibi and burning an effigy of the Punjab provincial governor who has supported her appeal.
</P>
<P>
"We will resist if the government moves against the court verdict and attempts to amend the blasphemy law," warned Tariq Naeemullah, a leader of Citizen Front of Multan.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Christians held their own protest in the southern city of Karachi, carrying a large crucifix and placards reading "Down with Black Law" and "Stop Discrimination Against Religious Minorities."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's higher courts have always struck down lower courts' death penalties in past blasphemy cases. Still, Bhatti said many who are falsely accused are unjustly jailed for months and often targeted by violence. Two Christian brothers in Punjab were gunned down earlier this year as they were leaving a court hearing on a blasphemy charge.
</P>
<P>
The minorities minister acknowledges that repealing the blasphemy law is politically unfeasible but has proposed changes to it including making it a crime to falsely accuse someone, abolishing the death penalty for the crime and requiring initial cases to be heard by higher courts instead of local ones.

The alleged shooter in the murder of American Indian Movement activist Annie Mae Aquash is expected to go on trial for murder starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
John Graham, a 55-year-old man from Canada, is accused of shooting Aquash in the head and leaving her to die on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota.
</P>

Prosecutors say Graham and two other members of AIM kidnapped Aquash in late 1975 because they suspected Aquash of being a government spy.

It took authorities almost three decades to charge Graham and a second member of AIM, Arlo Looking Cloud. Looking Cloud was convicted in 2004 and is serving a life sentence.

<P>
A long-delayed murder trial may shed light on who ordered the decades-old killing of an American Indian Movement activist who was shot in the head and left to die on South Dakota's Pine Ridge reservation.
</P>
<P>
John Graham, a Southern Tutchone Indian from Canada and former AIM member, heads to trial on murder charges this week in South Dakota court. Prosecutors allege Graham was one of three AIM activists who kidnapped and killed Annie Mae Aquash because AIM leaders believed she was a government spy.
</P>
<P>
Aquash's death, which occurred 35 years ago next month, quickly became synonymous with the violent clashes between AIM and federal authorities in the 1970s. One person has been convicted of the murder, and another pleaded guilty this month in connection with her kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
But one of Aquash's daughters says the real story behind what happened has yet to come out.
</P>
<P>
"Each time we go to trial, it reveals more of the truth," said Denise Maloney Pictou.
</P>
<P>
Graham, 55, has maintained his innocence in the killing. His attorney, John Murphy, did not respond to requests for comment. His daughter, Naneek Graham, has declined to comment lately but said in 2007 that Aquash was "a dear friend of his."
</P>
<P>
Among those who could testify at Graham's trial are Arlo Looking Cloud, who was convicted in 2004 in connection with Aquash's murder and has said Graham pulled the trigger, and Thelma Rios, who pleaded guilty this month to being an accessory to Aquash's kidnapping and received a suspended prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
Rios was originally to go on trial with Graham. Now, her plea could prove pivotal to Graham's prosecution. In a court hearing this month, Rios said she relayed a message to AIM members in Colorado that Aquash should be taken from Denver to Rapid City, the Rapid City Journal reported. She also acknowledged hearing discussions about whether Aquash should be killed, the Journal reported.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, Rios leads to other people," said Paul DeMain, an Indian journalist who has long researched the Aquash case. "(Graham) was a young guy who was a gofer. He wanted to prove himself."
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's theory, based on court documents and witnesses, is that Graham, Looking Cloud and a third AIM member, Theda Clark, were told in late 1975 to take Aquash from Denver to Rios' apartment in Rapid City. There, she was interrogated by AIM members and allegedly raped by Graham. Aquash was driven to the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations, then killed and left in a ravine, where her body was found in February 1976.
</P>
<P>
Richard Marshall, a Rapid City man who was accused of providing a .32-caliber pistol to Graham and Clark, was acquitted of murder charges in April. Clark, who is in her 80s and lives in a Nebraska nursing home, has never been charged and refused to testify.
</P>
<P>
AIM leaders have consistently denied personal involvement in Aquash's death.
</P>
<P>
Russell Means, an early leader of AIM, has blamed Vernon Bellecourt, another group leader, for ordering the murder. He called Graham and Looking Cloud "the most vulnerable of Indian people."
</P>
<P>
"They're only picking on those, the most vulnerable, the easiest to convict, because nobody cares about them," Means said in a telephone interview. When asked whether he was involved, Means replied, "Get real."
</P>
<P>
Vernon Bellecourt denied allegations against him in a 2004 interview with The Associated Press, four years before he died. "To this day I don't know who shot Anna Mae Aquash," he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
AIM co-founder Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt's brother, did not respond to questions in a brief phone interview. Dennis Banks, another leader mentioned in previous trials, did not return a message seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
Aquash's death came six months after two FBI agents were gunned down in a shootout with AIM members on Pine Ridge, and two years after AIM's 71-day occupation of Wounded Knee, in which Aquash participated.
</P>
<P>
For years, witnesses refused to come forward. Many feared retribution from AIM or distrusted the FBI, said Norman Zigrossi, who was in charge of the FBI's Rapid City office at the time.
</P>
<P>
Theories about a cover-up abounded after the doctor who performed Aquash's first autopsy missed signs that she was murdered and concluded she died from exposure to the cold. Her body later had to be exhumed, and she was eventually buried in her native Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
"The environment was such that the Indians on Pine Ridge didn't trust us," Zigrossi said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors indicted Graham and Looking Cloud in 2003. Looking Cloud was tried and convicted the following year and given a mandatory sentence of life in prison. In testimony at Marshall's trial this year, Looking Cloud acknowledged standing nearby as Graham shot Aquash, then taking the gun from him and firing all the bullets in a different direction.
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid (he) might shoot me next," Looking Cloud said, according to a trial transcript.
</P>
<P>
Graham was arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia, and fought extradition for four years before being sent to South Dakota in December 2007.
</P>
<P>
But the federal charges against Graham were repeatedly dismissed because prosecutors couldn't prove they had the authority to charge him, as Graham and Aquash are both from Canadian tribes. State prosecutors then charged Graham with three counts of felony murder late last year.
</P>
<P>
Longtime observers of the case say Graham, as the alleged shooter, could lead authorities further.
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt that John Graham could lead to the leadership," DeMain said. "Graham going to prison for the rest of his life is not the necessary thing."
</P>
<P>
Maloney Pictou says she hopes Graham's trial will help bring justice to her family.
</P>
<P>
"This is not about sending as many people as we can to prison," she said in a phone interview. "It's about finding the truth and exposing it and taking responsibility."

Opening statements given in AIM murder trial

<DATELINE>
RAPID CITY, South Dakota 2010-12-01 19:59:20 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of delays and legal wrangling, a murder trial began Wednesday for a man accused of shooting an American Indian Movement activist 35 years ago on South Dakota's Pine Ridge reservation.
</P>
<P>
During his opening statement, South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley recounted for jurors what investigators believe happened in the three days leading up to the December 1975 slaying of Annie Mae Aquash. He told them the defendant, John Graham, 55, shot her because the activist group's leaders thought she was a government informant.
</P>
<P>
Graham's attorney, John Murphy, countered in his opening statement that the prosecution lacked a murder weapon, fingerprints or other physical evidence to link Graham with Aquash's killing or the site of her death.
</P>
<P>
Graham, a Southern Tutchone Indian from Canada, is charged with first- and second-degree murder in the slaying of Aquash, and could be sent to prison for life if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Aquash's death became synonymous with AIM and its often violent struggles with federal agents in the 1970s, and family members and observers have said Graham's trial could help to answer lingering questions about why Aquash died and who ordered her killing.
</P>
<P>
During his narrative about what the state believes happened, Jackley told jurors that Graham and two other AIM activists, Arlo Looking Cloud and Theda Clark, were told in late 1975 to take Aquash from Denver to Rapid City, to the apartment of Thelma Rios.
</P>
<P>
Looking Cloud was found guilty of his involvement in the murder in 2004 and will likely testify at Graham's trial. Rios pleaded guilty last month in connection with Aquash's kidnapping and may also testify.
</P>
<P>
Graham, Looking Cloud and Clark, according to Jackley, then took Aquash from Rapid City onto the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations. The four finally stopped near a highway on Pine Ridge, Jackley said.
</P>
<P>
"John Graham knew the task at hand and he got out of the vehicle," Jackley said.
</P>
<P>
There, Jackley told jurors, Graham shot Aquash in the back of the head as Looking Cloud stood nearby.
</P>
<P>
Jackley said witnesses would show that AIM leaders considered Aquash dangerous and that Graham later suggested that he felt remorse for the crime.
</P>
<P>
Murphy told jurors that the prosecution lacked the physical evidence to link Graham with Aquash's killing or the site of her death.
</P>
<P>
He questioned the credibility of two witnesses he said were central to the prosecution's case: Looking Cloud and Serle Chapman, a British journalist who interviewed Graham and cooperated with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
Murphy accused Looking Cloud of changing his story in the hope of having his life sentence reduced, and Chapman of lying to get money and help with immigration from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
"Simply put, I ask you to listen so you can engage how believable any of these people are," Murphy said of the prosecution's witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Aquash, a member of the Mi'kmaq tribe of Nova Scotia, was 30 when she died in late 1975. Her death came about six months after two FBI agents were gunned down in a shootout with AIM members, and two years after she participated in AIM's 71-day occupation of the South Dakota reservation town of Wounded Knee.
</P>
<P>
AIM was founded in the late 1960s to protest the U.S. government's treatment of Indians and demand the government honor its treaties with Indian tribes. It first gained national attention in 1972 when it took over the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters in Washington, but has since faded from public view.
</P>
<P>
Graham was first indicted in 2003 and extradited to South Dakota four years later to face federal murder charges. But after federal courts ruled that U.S. prosecutors didn't have authority to prosecute Graham, he was indicted in state court.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors were calling their first witnesses Wednesday afternoon.

Trial testimony begins in 1975 reservation murder
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
RAPID CITY, South Dakota 2010-12-02 03:23:55 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of delays and legal wrangling, a murder trial began Wednesday for a man accused of shooting an American Indian Movement activist 35 years ago on a reservation.
</P>
<P>
South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley recounted for jurors what investigators believe happened in the three days leading up to the December 1975 slaying of Annie Mae Aquash on South Dakota's Pine Ridge reservation. He said the defendant, John Graham, 55, shot her because the activist group's leaders thought she was a government informant.
</P>
<P>
Graham's attorney, John Murphy, countered in his opening statement that the prosecution lacked a murder weapon, fingerprints or other physical evidence to link Graham with Aquash's killing or the site of her death.
</P>
<P>
Graham, a Southern Tutchone tribal member from Canada, is charged with first- and second-degree murder. He could be sent to prison for life if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Aquash's death became synonymous with the American Indian Movement and its often violent struggles with federal agents in the 1970s. Family members and observers have said Graham's trial could help answer lingering questions about why Aquash died and who ordered her killing.
</P>
<P>
During his narrative about what the state believes happened, Jackley told jurors that Graham and two other AIM activists, Arlo Looking Cloud and Theda Clark, were told in late 1975 to take Aquash from Denver to Rapid City, to the apartment of Thelma Rios.
</P>
<P>
Graham, Looking Cloud and Clark then took Aquash to the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations, and eventually stopped near a highway on Pine Ridge, Jackley said.
</P>
<P>
"John Graham knew the task at hand and he got out of the vehicle," Jackley said. The prosecutor said Graham then shot Aquash in the back of the head as Looking Cloud stood nearby.
</P>
<P>
Looking Cloud was found guilty of his involvement in the murder in 2004 and will likely testify at Graham's trial. Rios pleaded guilty last month in connection with Aquash's kidnapping and may also testify.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution called five witnesses Wednesday, including federal agents who first investigated Aquash's death after her unidentified body was found in February 1976.
</P>
<P>
Aquash, a member of the Mi'kmaq tribe of Nova Scotia, was 30 when she died. Her death came about six months after two FBI agents were gunned down in a shootout with AIM members, and two years after she participated in AIM's 71-day occupation of the South Dakota reservation town of Wounded Knee.
</P>
<P>
Former FBI special agent John Munis testified about how a pathologist removed Aquash's hands from her corpse in a lab in Washington to analyze them for fingerprints. Her cause of death was mistakenly listed as exposure to the cold, and her body was buried in March 1976 -- before it was identified.
</P>
<P>
Former FBI special agent William Wood testified that he requested Aquash's body be exhumed after learning her identity. A second pathologist found a .32-caliber bullet.
</P>
<P>
Former Bureau of Indian Affairs officer Nathan Merrick said he noticed what looked like dry blood near Aquash's head when he arrived where her body was discovered. During cross-examination, Murphy said the FBI didn't note foul play on its initial reports. Merrick replied: "That's a question for them."
</P>
<P>
Roger Amiotte, the rancher who found Aquash's body, and Ray Hand Boy, who drove Aquash to Denver in November 1975, also testified. More witnesses are expected Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jackley said witnesses would show that AIM leaders considered Aquash dangerous and that Graham later suggested he felt remorse for the crime.
</P>
<P>
Murphy questioned the credibility of two witnesses he said were central to the prosecution's case: Looking Cloud and Serle Chapman, a British journalist who interviewed Graham and cooperated with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
Murphy accused Looking Cloud of changing his story in the hope of having his life sentence reduced, and Chapman of lying to get money and help with immigration from the FBI.

Pakistani cleric calls for Christian to be killed
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PESHAWAR, Pakistan 2010-12-03 15:41:58 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hardline Pakistani cleric offered a cash reward Friday for anyone who kills a Christian woman convicted of blasphemy against Islam.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani court sentenced Asia Bibi to death on Nov. 8, triggering protests from human rights groups and Christian organizations in Pakistan and abroad. Islamist political parties have demonstrated in support of the sentence and the blasphemy laws.
</P>
<P>
Yousef Qureshi made the call for her murder at a rally in the northwestern town of Peshawar.
</P>
<P>
"The Mohabat Khan mosque of Peshawar will pay a reward of 500,000 rupees ($5,800) to those who kill Asia Bibi," Qureshi told around 300 people, referring to the mosque he preaches at.
</P>
<P>
City authorities were not immediately available for comment on his remarks.
</P>
<P>
Christians accused of, or convicted of blasphemy, have been murdered before in Pakistan. Rights groups say police are often reluctant to investigate the crimes or give minorities protection in general.
</P>
<P>
Later, Qureshi told reporters that his first demand was for the government to execute Bibi. If not, he said, "then we appeal to the mujahedeen, the Taliban and all those who love the Prophet to come forward and kill this woman."
</P>
<P>
Bibi, a 45-year-old mother of five, has been in jail in Punjab province for the last 1 1/2 years after being convicted of insulting the Prophet Muhammad. She and her family say she is innocent and the victim of a personal feud. She has been supported by the governor of Punjab, as well as Pakistan's minority affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Pakistanis are sentenced to death each year under the blasphemy law, which dates back to the 1980s military rule of Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who introduced it to get support from right-wing Islamist parties. The current government is secular but politically weak. Any attempt to repeal it would be met with opposition.

US says Cuba detention of contractor hurts ties
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HAVANA 2010-12-03 18:36:34 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The yearlong detention of an American subcontractor by Cuba is a "major impediment" to improved ties, the U.S. State Department said Friday, some of the strongest language yet from Washington in a case that has short-circuited nascent hopes for rapprochement between the Cold War enemies.
</P>
<P>
The statement from department spokesman P.J. Crowley comes on the one-year anniversary of the arrest of Alan Gross, whom Cuban President Raul Castro has accused of spying. Gross has not been charged with any crime, however.
</P>
<P>
"It is long overdue for Cuban authorities to release Mr. Gross," the statement read. "He has languished in a Cuban jail for a full year and the Cuban Government has yet to explain reasons for his detention or file charges. His arrest and continued detention without charge violate international standards of due process and judicial procedure."
</P>
<P>
"We have made it very clear to the Cuban Government that the continued detention of Alan Gross is a major impediment to advancing the dialogue between our two countries," the State Deparmtent said.
</P>
<P>
It vowed to use "every available channel to urge the Cuban Government to put an end to Mr. Gross' long and unjustifiable ordeal."
</P>
<P>
Cuban officials have said previously the case is working its way through the legal system and there is nothing unusual about the period he has spent in jail.
</P>
<P>
Gross, a native of Potomac, Maryland, was working for a firm contracted by USAID when he was arrested Dec. 3, 2009. His family denies he was spying, saying he brought communications equipment for use by the local Jewish community, not dissidents.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Gross is an international development worker who traveled to Cuba to help connect members of the Jewish community in Havana with other Jewish communities throughout the world," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two largest groups for Cuba's 1,500-strong Jewish community said in Havana this week that they never met Gross and were not working with him.
</P>
<P>
Havana says USAID's programs to promote democratic change in Cuba are meant to subvert the government by bankrolling opposition activity.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and the United States have been at odds since shortly after Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, and the U.S. has maintained an economic embargo on the island for 48 years.
</P>
<P>
The Gross case has complicated hopes for a thaw that rose after the election of President Barack Obama, whose administration says it has worked to relieve tensions in a number of ways, including easing limits on Cuban-Americans who want to travel or send money to the island that were imposed by George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from both countries have also met to discuss resuming direct mail service and tackle immigration issues, as well as relief efforts in earthquake-ravaged Haiti.

Raul Castro celebrates Hanukkah with Cuban Jews
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HAVANA 2010-12-06 03:50:48 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Raul Castro celebrated Hanukkah on Sunday with Cuba's tiny Jewish community, a heavily symbolic act at a time when his government is holding a Jewish-American subcontractor on suspicion of spying.
</P>
<P>
Neither Castro nor those assembled at Havana's Shalom synagogue mentioned the name Alan Gross during the gathering, which was broadcast on the state-television newscast Sunday evening. But Gross's one-year detention without charge was the elephant in the room.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government says Gross was in Cuba as part of a USAID program to distribute communications equipment to the island's 1,500-strong Jewish community, and both the State Department and Gross's wife, Judy, made fresh appeals this week for his release. The leaders of Havana's two main Jewish groups have denied having anything to do with him.
</P>
<P>
Castro wore a suit and a yarmulke, the head covering which observant Jews wear as a symbol of their deference to God, and was given the honor of lighting the first candle of the menorah. It was the first time in more than a decade that either Castro or his brother Fidel appeared with the Jewish community at a religious celebration like Hanukkah.
</P>
<P>
The brothers have gone out of their way to show their support for the Jewish people in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Fidel Castro took time out from his warnings about a looming nuclear war pitting the U.S and Israel against Iran to say that he disagreed with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's denials of the Holocaust. He said: "I don't think anyone has been slandered more than the Jews" adding that Jews "were expelled from their land, persecuted and mistreated all over the world."
</P>
<P>
The comments won rare praise from Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Raul Castro, who took over the presidency from his brother in 2006, thanked his hosts for a "very enjoyable afternoon," and said he hoped to have more time on another occasion to come and talk about "the Hebrew community in Cuba and the fabulous history of the Hebrew people."
</P>
<P>
Castro noted that he will turn 80 in June, but said he was "in good health." He said he was pleased that his country had begun to hold discussions on the need for a major economic overhaul. Cuba has announced that it is laying off 500,000 state workers, while allowing for more private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Gross, a native of Potomac, Maryland, was arrested Dec. 3, 2009. His family denies he was spying, saying he brought communications equipment for use by the local Jewish community, not dissidents. The U.S. government says his continued detention is a "major impediment" to improved ties between the two Cold War enemies.
</P>
<P>
Hanukkah is the Festival of Lights for Jews. The holiday commemorates the rededication of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem in 164 B.C. According to tradition, a candelabra was lit with only enough oil for one day, but it miraculously burned for eight days.

Man testifies at US trial he saw AIM activist shot
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
RAPID CITY, South Dakota 2010-12-07 03:13:09 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who is serving a life sentence for his role in the 1975 death of an American Indian Movement activist testified Monday that he stood nearby and watched another man shoot her.
</P>
<P>
Arlo Looking Cloud testified against John Graham, saying he watched as Graham shot Annie Mae Aquash on South Dakota's Pine Ridge reservation and left her to die. Graham, a Southern Tutchone tribal member from Canada, is charged with first- and second-degree murder and could be sent to prison for life if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe Graham, Looking Cloud and a third AIM activist, Theda Clark, kidnapped and killed Aquash because AIM leaders thought she was a government spy. The death of Aquash, who was also Canadian, has long been synonymous with AIM and its often-violent struggles with federal agents during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Clark also appeared in court but told a judge she would exercise her constitutional right not to incriminate herself. Clark has never been charged in Aquash's 1975 death.
</P>
<P>
Looking Cloud, who was convicted of murder in 2004, testified that he, Graham and Clark kidnapped Aquash from Denver and took her to Rapid City. He said he heard Graham and Aquash having sex in the bedroom of a Rapid City apartment. Prosecutors have alleged that Graham raped Aquash.
</P>
<P>
Looking Cloud said the four then drove toward Pine Ridge. He said the group eventually stopped on a dark highway in the Badlands, where Graham took Aquash out of Clark's Ford Pinto.
</P>
<P>
When prosecutor Rod Oswald asked what happened next, Looking Cloud replied: "I (see) him standing with Anna Mae, and then I see him shooting her."
</P>
<P>
Graham's attorney, John Murphy, raised questions about Looking Cloud's criminal background and motivation for testifying. Murphy suggested he had embellished his story to get his life sentence reduced.
</P>
<P>
Murphy said Looking Cloud had previously described Graham and Aquash as friends and said the sex allegation was "something you started talking about in 2008."
</P>
<P>
He said Looking Cloud did not include several details about the murder weapon and where the four stopped on Pine Ridge until a few years ago. "It hadn't become part of the storyline," Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
Looking Cloud agreed that he had left out details before, but repeatedly said he was trying to tell the truth now.
</P>
<P>
Murphy was expected to continue questioning Looking Cloud Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, another witness testified that she and Aquash heard AIM activist Leonard Peltier admit to killing two FBI agents in June 1975. Peltier was convicted in 1977 of shooting the agents and is serving a life sentence. He has maintained his innocence, saying the FBI framed him. The agency denies that claim.
</P>
<P>
Darlene "Kamook" Ecoffey told jurors Peltier talked about the shooting in the fall of 1975, a few months before Aquash disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Delaney originally ruled Ecoffey couldn't testify about Peltier's comment because it was hearsay, but he reversed his decision Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also questioned a former suspect about a visit Graham and the others allegedly made to his home shortly before Aquash's death. Richard Marshall was found not guilty in April of supplying the .32-caliber pistol used to kill Aquash.
</P>
<P>
Marshall testified Monday he didn't give Graham a gun or keep weapons in his house. He said he didn't remember Looking Cloud, Graham or Aquash, and he denied having a private conversation with Clark, Graham and Looking Cloud in a bedroom of his home, as his former wife, Cleo Gates, testified Friday.
</P>
<P>
He did not testify at his own trial and did not want to testify at Graham's, even though prosecutors offered him full immunity. South Dakota Judge John Delaney said Marshall couldn't invoke his constitutional right not to incriminate himself if immunity was offered.
</P>
<P>
Jackley, the state attorney general, later asked Marshall whether he remembered an interview with British writer Serle Chapman -- a likely government witness later this week -- in which Marshall talked about that night. Marshall said he couldn't.
</P>
<P>
After prompting from Jackley, Marshall acknowledged he remembered Clark asking him to let Aquash stay in his home, but that he refused.
</P>
<P>
Graham's attorney, John Murphy, asked Marshall whether he had any discussions with Graham, Looking Cloud or Clark about hurting Aquash.
</P>
<P>
Aquash, a member of the Mi'kmaq tribe of Nova Scotia, was 30 when she died. Her death came about two years after she participated in AIM's 71-day occupation of the South Dakota reservation town of Wounded Knee.

Witness: Suspect in AIM slaying ' got real nervous '

<TEXT>
<P>
The Canadian man accused of shooting an American Indian Movement activist in late 1975 acted nervous and his hand shook when he was asked about her almost two decades later, a federal investigator said in court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Robert Ecoffey, a former U.S. marshal, testified against John Graham, who's accused of shooting Annie Mae Aquash, who was also Canadian, and leaving her to die on South Dakota's Pine Ridge reservation.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe Graham, and two other AIM activists, Arlo Looking Cloud and Theda Clark, kidnapped and killed Aquash because AIM leaders thought she was a government spy. Aquash's death has long been synonymous with AIM and its often-violent struggles with federal agents during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Ecoffey told jurors that he and another federal agent met with Graham in April 1994 in Yellowknife, the city in northwest Canada where Graham lived at the time. Ecoffey said he approached Graham one afternoon at work.
</P>
<P>
When Ecoffey introduced himself and told Graham why he wanted to talk, Graham allegedly replied, "How did you find out about me?"
</P>
<P>
Ecoffey said he told Graham about an alleged meeting in Denver regarding Aquash. Other witnesses have said the meeting included discussion of whether Aquash was an informant.
</P>
<P>
"He got real nervous," Ecoffey said and added that Graham's hand quivered as he held a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
Graham decided to meet with Ecoffey and the other agent, Mitch Pourier of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, at a Yellowknife park that night. Ecoffey is expected to testify about that meeting Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ecoffey is now the BIA superintendent for the Pine Ridge reservation and married to another witness, Darlene "Kamook" Ecoffey, who testified Monday.
</P>
<P>
Looking Cloud, who started his testimony Monday, returned to the stand earlier Tuesday and repeated his claim that he saw Graham take Aquash out of a car and stood nearby as Graham shot her.
</P>
<P>
Looking Cloud was convicted in 2004 for his role in Aquash's death and is serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
Graham's attorney, John Murphy, contended that Looking Cloud was just looking for a more lenient sentence and continued to grill him over differences between his current testimony and what he previously told investigators, including Ecoffey.
</P>
<P>
Aquash's older daughter, Denise Maloney Pictou, also testified Tuesday. She described a 2002 phone call in which she said Looking Cloud told her that Graham and Clark took Aquash from the car and that he only heard a gunshot.
</P>
<P>
Maloney Pictou, who was 10 when Aquash disappeared, said she last saw her mother in September 1975.
</P>
<P>
"There were lots of conversations amongst the adults," Maloney Pictou recalled. "There were requests for her not to leave."
</P>
<P>
Aquash, a member of the Mi'kmaq tribe of Nova Scotia, was 30 when she died. Her death came about two years after she participated in AIM's 71-day occupation of the South Dakota reservation town of Wounded Knee.
</P>
<P>
AIM was founded in the late 1960s to protest the U.S. government's treatment of Indians and demand the government honor its treaties with Indian tribes. It gained national attention in 1972 when it took over the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters in Washington but has since faded from public view.
</P>
<P>
Graham, a 55-year-old Southern Tutchone Indian from Canada, faces first- and second-degree murder charges and could receive life in prison if convicted.

</P>
<P>
Graham decided to meet with Ecoffey and the other agent, Mitch Pourier of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, at a Whitehorse park that night. Ecoffey is expected to testify about that meeting Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ecoffey is now the BIA superintendent for the Pine Ridge reservation and married to another witness, Darlene "Kamook" Ecoffey, who testified Monday.
</P>
<P>
Looking Cloud, who started his testimony Monday, returned to the stand earlier Tuesday and repeated his claim that he saw Graham take Aquash out of a car and stood nearby as Graham shot her.
</P>
<P>
Looking Cloud was convicted in 2004 for his role in Aquash's death and is serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
Graham's attorney, John Murphy, contended that Looking Cloud was just looking for a more lenient sentence and continued to grill him over differences between his current testimony and what he previously told investigators, including Ecoffey.
</P>
<P>
Aquash's older daughter, Denise Maloney Pictou, also testified Tuesday. She described a 2002 phone call in which she said Looking Cloud told her that Graham and Clark took Aquash from the car and that he only heard a gunshot.
</P>
<P>
Maloney Pictou, who was 10 when Aquash disappeared, said she last saw her mother in September 1975.
</P>
<P>
"There were lots of conversations amongst the adults," Maloney Pictou recalled. "There were requests for her not to leave."
</P>
<P>
Aquash, a member of the Mi'kmaq tribe of Nova Scotia, was 30 when she died. Her death came about two years after she participated in AIM's 71-day occupation of the South Dakota reservation town of Wounded Knee.
</P>
<P>
AIM was founded in the late 1960s to protest the U.S. government's treatment of Indians and demand the government honor its treaties with tribes. It gained national attention in 1972 when it took over the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters in Washington but has since faded from public view.
</P>
<P>
Graham, a 55-year-old Southern Tutchone Indian from Canada, faces first- and second-degree murder charges and could receive life in prison if convicted.

Prosecution rests in 1975 AIM slaying trial

<P>
The prosecution rested its case Tuesday in the trial of a Canadian man accused of shooting an American Indian Movement activist in late 1975 and leaving her to die, after two federal agents testified that the suspect became nervous while discussing the crime.
</P>
<P>
John Graham is charged with shooting Annie Mae Aquash and leaving the Canadian woman to die on South Dakota's Pine Ridge reservation in a case that has become synonymous with AIM's often-violent clashes with federal agents during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Prosecution witnesses testified over five days that Graham and two other AIM activists, Arlo Looking Cloud and Theda Clark, kidnapped and killed Aquash because they believed she was a government informant. Looking Cloud, who is serving a life sentence for his role in Aquash's death, told jurors Monday and Tuesday that he saw Graham shoot her.
</P>
<P>
After two agents testified Tuesday, lead prosecutor Marty Jackley said he had finished presenting his case. Graham's attorney, John Murphy, will begin calling witnesses Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Murphy has accused Looking Cloud of changing his story in hopes of having his sentence reduced and pointed out differences between his testimony and earlier statements made to investigators.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Marshal Robert Ecoffey and Bureau of Indian Affairs special agent Mitch Pourier testified Tuesday that they met with Graham in April 1994 in the western Canada town of Whitehorse, where Graham lived at the time. The agents said Graham told them he drove Aquash from Denver to a "safe house" in South Dakota, but he denied killing her.
</P>
<P>
Ecoffey said he and Pourier approached Graham one afternoon at work. When Ecoffey introduced himself and told Graham why he wanted to talk, Graham allegedly replied, "How did you find out about me?"
</P>
<P>
"He got real nervous," Ecoffey said and added that Graham's hand quivered as he held a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
That night, the three met at a Whitehorse park. They sat at a picnic table as Ecoffey began to discuss what he knew about the case, he testified. Graham allegedly said, "Well, look like you guys have my future planned out for me. You have your case."
</P>
<P>
Pourier said Graham denied shooting Aquash but began shaking so violently that their picnic table "was actually moving." And both agents testified that Graham later said, "I'm ready to leave this place. I'll probably spend the rest of my life in jail."
</P>
<P>
Murphy suggested Graham's reactions stemmed from fear and he questioned why the agents didn't record the conversation. "Had you guys done that, we might actually know what (Graham) said," Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
Pourier said he was confident the interview report filed by the agents was accurate.
</P>
<P>
Looking Cloud took the stand Tuesday morning for a second day and reiterated that he stood nearby as Graham shot Aquash.
</P>
<P>
Murphy contended Looking Cloud had changed his story in hopes of getting a more lenient prison sentence. He pointed to Looking Cloud's criminal record, which includes several convictions for lying to authorities, and differences between his current testimony and past statements.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors did not call a number of expected witnesses, but they can still do so after the defense rests. Potential witnesses who didn't testify include Serle Chapman, a British writer who interviewed Graham and later cooperated with the FBI, and Thelma Rios, who pleaded guilty last month in connection with Aquash's kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
Aquash, a member of the Mi'kmaq tribe of Nova Scotia, was 30 when she died. Her death came about two years after she participated in AIM's 71-day occupation of the South Dakota reservation town of Wounded Knee.
</P>
<P>
AIM was founded in the late 1960s to protest the U.S. government's treatment of Native Americans and demand the government honor its treaties with tribes. It gained national attention in 1972 when it took over the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters in Washington but has since faded from public view.

Jury convicts man in SD reservation slaying

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury Friday convicted a man of murder in the shooting death of an American Indian activist on a South Dakota reservation in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The jury found John Graham guilty of felony murder in the kidnapping of Annie Mae Aquash, whose death became linked to the American Indian Movement and its often-violent struggles with federal agents during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The jury acquitted Graham of premeditated murder, but Attorney General Marty Jackley, who prosecuted the case, said both murder charges carry a mandatory sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors alleged Graham and two other AIM activists killed Aquash because they thought she was a government informant. Graham's attorney, John Murphy, didn't call any witnesses but questioned the reliability of several prosecution witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Jurors took a day and a half to return its verdicts for Graham, a 55-year-old Southern Tutchone Indian from Canada, after briefly telling the judge late Friday that they had deadlocked on one of the charges. They soon returned with a decision on both counts.
</P>
<P>
During five days of testimony, prosecution witnesses testified that they saw Graham and two other AIM supporters, Arlo Looking Cloud and Theda Clark, tie Aquash's hands and place her in the back of a red Ford Pinto. The three took Aquash from Denver toward the Pine Ridge reservation, witnesses testified.
</P>
<P>
A key prosecution witness was Looking Cloud, who was convicted six years ago for his role in Aquash's murder and is serving life in prison. Looking Cloud said he stood nearby as Graham shot Aquash.
</P>
<P>
And two federal agents, former U.S. Marshal Robert Ecoffey and Bureau of Indian Affairs agent Mitch Pourier, said they saw Graham become nervous and talk about going to jail after they asked him about the murder in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But a number of expected prosecution witnesses -- including Serle Chapman, a British writer who interviewed Graham, and Thelma Rios, who pleaded guilty in November in connection with Aquash's kidnapping -- didn't take the stand.
</P>
<P>
Murphy questioned several prosecution witnesses -- particularly Looking Cloud -- on conflicts between their testimony and statements they had made before. Murphy accused Looking Cloud of embellishing his story and treating Graham like a "meal ticket" to a more lenient prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
AIM was founded in the late 1960s to protest the U.S. government's treatment of American Indians and demand the government honor its treaties with Indian tribes. It gained national attention in 1972 when it took over the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters in Washington but has since faded from public view.
</P>
<P>
The conviction comes after an investigation that started shortly after Aquash's body was found in February 1976. For years, witnesses refused to come forward. But authorities began to make progress in the 1990s, and Graham and Looking Cloud were indicted in federal court in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Graham was extradited four years later, but the federal charges against him were thrown out because neither he nor Aquash were American citizens. A state court then indicted Graham last year.
</P>
<P>
Aquash, a member of the Mi'kmaq tribe of Nova Scotia, was 30 when she died. Her death came about two years after she participated in AIM's 71-day occupation of the South Dakota reservation town of Wounded Knee.

Jury convicts man in US Indian activist ' s death

<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors needed only about four hours to agree that John Graham and two other American Indian Movement supporters kidnapped a fellow activist in 1975 and killed her on the Pine Ridge reservation, one jury member said. But they weren't all convinced it was Graham who pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
After a second day of deliberations Friday, the 12 jurors convicted Graham of felony murder during the kidnapping of Annie Mae Aquash -- whose death came to symbolize AIM and its often violent struggles with federal agents during the 1970s -- but acquitted him of premeditated murder.
</P>
<P>
Juror Barry Winter said that although he and 11 others came to swift agreement Graham was culpable in Aquash's death, there was disagreement about his role. Arlo Looking Cloud, who was convicted in Aquash's slaying six years ago and is serving a life sentence, was the only witness who testified to seeing Graham kill Aquash. Looking Cloud said he stood nearby as it happened.
</P>
<P>
The jury eventually decided there wasn't enough evidence to convict Graham, a 55-year-old Southern Tutchone Indian from Canada, of premeditation, Winter said.
</P>
<P>
"On the first count, we came to a fairly short resolution that he was guilty," Winter told The Associated Press. "On the second one, that's what we spent a lot of time on."
</P>
<P>
Lead prosecutor Marty Jackley, the state's attorney general, said the felony murder charge carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison. Jackley said Friday he wasn't sure whether parole was an option.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the activists who kidnapped and killed Aquash believed she was a government spy, which authorities have denied.
</P>
<P>
As South Dakota Judge John Delaney read the verdicts Friday, Graham gazed straight ahead without moving. His daughter, Naneek Graham, began to weep as jurors stood one by one to affirm the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
Aquash's daughters, Denise Maloney Pictou and Debbie Maloney Pictou, later embraced prosecutors and cried.
</P>
<P>
"We waited 35 years," Denise Maloney Pictou said. "It's been a long road for us."
</P>
<P>
During five days of testimony, prosecution witnesses testified they saw Graham, Looking Cloud and another AIM supporter tie Aquash's hands and place her in the back of a red Ford Pinto. The three took Aquash from Denver toward South Dakota's Pine Ridge reservation, witnesses testified.
</P>
<P>
Graham's attorney, John Murphy, had accused Looking Cloud of embellishing his story and treating Graham like a "meal ticket" to a more lenient prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
Winter, the juror, said he thought Looking Cloud "conveyed honestly what he felt he was a witness to."
</P>
<P>
"Most of us felt his testimony was credible also, to a degree," Winter said.
</P>
<P>
The defense called no witnesses during the trial. Instead, Murphy questioned several prosecution witnesses -- particularly Looking Cloud -- about conflicts between their testimony and previous statements.
</P>
<P>
Murphy wasn't available for comment after the verdicts were read. Graham's daughter and relatives did not comment as they left the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
Aquash's body was found in February 1976, but witnesses refused to come forward for years. Authorities began making progress in the 1990s, and Graham and Looking Cloud were indicted in federal court in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Graham was extradited four years later, but the federal charges against him were thrown out because neither he nor Aquash were American citizens. A state court then indicted Graham last year.
</P>
<P>
Aquash, a member of the Mi'kmaq tribe of Nova Scotia, was 30 when she died. Her death came about two years after she participated in AIM's 71-day occupation of the South Dakota reservation town of Wounded Knee -- the site of an 1890 massacre in which more than 150 Sioux men, women and children were killed by U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
AIM was founded in the late 1960s to protest the U.S. government's treatment of American Indians and demand the government honor its treaties with Indian tribes. It gained national attention in 1972 when it took over the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters in Washington but has since faded from public view.

<P>
Lady Gaga isn't having much luck in Paris.
</P>
<P>
In October, the pop diva's concerts in Paris were postponed amid massive nationwide strikes over a government plan to raise the retirement age. One show was rescheduled for Sunday, but it was called off because of snow.
</P>
<P>
The weather led authorities to ban big trucks from driving through the Ile de France region that includes Paris. Concert venue Bercy stadium says on its Web site that Lady Gaga's trucks couldn't get to the venue on time.
</P>
<P>
Bercy says a concert Monday is expected to go forward as planned, and the canceled show is likely to be rescheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The diva vented on Twitter, writing that "all 28" of the trucks carrying sets for her elaborate show had been detained.

Envoy warns Ivory Coast ' on brink of genocide '
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
UNITED NATIONS 2010-12-29 21:07:00 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ivory Coast's new U.N. ambassador said Wednesday that an increasingly dangerous tug-of-war over the presidency is pushing the West African country to "the brink of genocide."
</P>
<P>
Veteran diplomat Youssoufou Bamba said he's already consulting with members of the new Security Council before its first meeting next week about ways to help president-elect Alassane Ouattara assume power.
</P>
<P>
Laurent Gbagbo, the incumbent, refuses to step down although the world recognizes Ouattara as the winner of recent elections.
</P>
<P>
"I intend to meet with all 15 members" of the new council, Bamba told reporters shortly after presenting his diplomatic credentials to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
</P>
<P>
He noted that at least 173 people already have been killed "only because they want to demonstrate, they want to speak out, they want to defend the will of the people."
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the messages I'm trying to get across in the consultations I've conducted so far, to tell them we are on the brink of genocide," Bamba said. "Something should be done."
</P>
<P>
He implied that Ouattara supporters, whose strongholds are largely in the north, could be targeted by Gbagbo backers, saying: "If houses are being marked according to your tribe, what is going to be next?"
</P>
<P>
The U.N. documented the 173 killings between Dec. 16 and 21 and says that at least 90 other people have been tortured or treated inhumanely because of postelection violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. deputy human rights commissioner, Kyung-wha Kang, told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva late last week that human rights advocates had documented at least 471 arrests and detentions and 24 cases of people who disappeared involuntarily.
</P>
<P>
But restrictions imposed on U.N. personnel have made it impossible for them to investigate many allegations about human rights violations in the country, including reports of mass graves.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a U.N. peacekeeper in Ivory Coast was wounded with a machete when his patrol was encircled by angry people in a pro-Gbagbo neighborhood. A U.N. armored personnel carrier was burned before the head of the national army personally intervened to allow the peacekeepers to retreat.
</P>
<P>
Bamba, a 60-year-old career diplomat, was Ivory Coast's ambassador to Washington in 2000-2001, and most recently before U.N. agencies in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that he was unsure how he would receive his salary with the nation's financial assets frozen while Gbagbo remains in power. But he didn't seem worried, saying: "I have been a diplomat for 25 years. I have some savings."

UN: Forces obstruct Ivory Coast mass grave probe
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast 2010-12-30 12:12:10 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United Nations accused incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo's security forces of continuing to block access to mass graves Thursday, saying investigators believe as many as 80 bodies may be in one building that U.N. personnel were kept from entering.
</P>
<P>
Gbagbo's government has repeatedly denied that such graves exist, and the interior minister has gone on state television to dismiss the allegations. Simon Munzu, the head of the U.N. human rights division, urged Gbagbo's security forces Thursday to allow investigators to corroborate that.
</P>
<P>
"We would be the very first to say that these stories are false if they turn out to be false," Munzu said. "Our findings on the matter and their announcement to the world would have a greater chance of being believed than these repeated denials."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has said that security forces accompanied by masked men with rocket launchers were preventing U.N. personnel from reaching the scene of one mass grave identified by witnesses in the area. Munzu said investigators got as far as the front door of a building where between 60 and 80 bodies are believed to be kept before they were forced to leave.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a fiery member of Gbagbo's Cabinet urged supporters to seize a hotel where the internationally recognized winner of last month's election has been organizing a shadow government under U.N. protection.
</P>
<P>
Charles Ble Goude was quoted by a pro-Gbagbo newspaper Thursday as saying that Alassane Ouattara, whom the United Nations declared the winner of the Nov. 28 vote, and his prime minister "have until January 1, 2011 to pack their bags and leave the Golf Hotel."
</P>
<P>
West African leaders on Wednesday took possible military intervention off the table for now so negotiations can continue next week to have Gbagbo hand over power in Ivory Coast. ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States, has sent combat troops to several nations in the past two decades. Defense officials from the member states met Wednesday in Abuja, Nigeria, where the bloc is based.
</P>
<P>
"He who attacks Laurent Gbagbo will sorely regret it," the newspaper Le Temps reported Ble Goude as telling Gbagbo supporters in the Yopougon neighborhood, where a U.N. patrol was surrounded by a mob on Tuesday and one peacekeeper was wounded by a machete. "No on can remove our president from power."
</P>
<P>
U.N. peacekeeping chief Alain Leroy said the U.N. has become a target of violence after a campaign of "disturbing lies" on state television suggested that the U.N. is arming and transporting anti-Gbagbo rebels.
</P>
<P>
Ble Goude is Gbagbo's minister of youth and employment, known as the "street general" for organizing a violent anti-French and anti-U.N. gang that terrorized the foreign population in Ivory Coast in 2004-2005. The beachside Golf Hotel is protected by hundreds of blue-helmeted U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Under a peace deal after the 2002-2003 civil war, the U.N. was tasked with certifying the results of the election. The U.N. declared Ouattara the winner, echoing the country's own electoral commission chief. Gbagbo insists he won, pointing out that the Ivory Coast constitutional council declared him the winner. The council, which is led by a Gbagbo ally, had invalidated half a million ballots from Ouattara strongholds in the north.
</P>
<P>
The United States and other world powers have insisted Gbagbo hand over power to Ouattara. For many, the credibility of the international community is at stake if it is unable to ensure that Ouattara takes power.
</P>
<P>
Chaos in Ivory Coast, once a West African economic powerhouse with skyscrapers dominating this seaside commercial center, already has kept Gbagbo in power five years beyond his mandate.
</P>
<P>
Ivory Coast's new U.N. ambassador, Youssoufou Bamba, said he is worried about his country's future and is consulting with members of the Security Council ahead of a meeting next week on ways to help Ouattara assume power.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the brink of genocide," Bamba said after presenting his diplomatic credentials to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in New York.
</P>
<P>
Practical obstacles may prevent ECOWAS troop deployment to Ivory Coast, said Africa security analyst Peter Pham. The best troops from ECOWAS states are already deployed on missions elsewhere such as Sudan, and even if soldiers could be found, transport logistics would be a challenge, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Gbagbo called their bluff on their ability to follow through on any sort of military threat," said Pham, of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a New York-based think tank. "Sending a peacekeeping force is one thing, but an invasion force that will be resisted by the national military is quite another."
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States has begun planning for the possible evacuation of its embassy in Ivory Coast amid concerns of a full-blown conflict.

They have the full armor addition (Ingalls concept with sandwiched Kevlar) and their hulls are more carefully built at the Sonar dome attachment in accordance with Iranian specifications when the Shah originally ordered them.

Actually I'm rather surprised somebody hadn't snapped them up sooner.

The USN doesn't want/need them anymore and they're far too valuable (compared to a Spruance-class) as a saleable asset to smaller countries to be deep-sixed as quickly as the Spru-cans.

I know Australia was considering them (or had been offered them) and I think maybe Greece was mentioned as well.

It's too bad really, I've always like the Kidds. But those Mark 26's are just too passé I guess (no Tomahawk/Standard ER or later), what with the Baseline 0/1 Tico's getting decomm'ed. I wonder how long before a For Sale sign is hung on their bows. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/frown.gif"/>

Of course, affordability could be a problem... <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/redface.gif"/>

In all seriousness, the Coast Guard is in desperate need of new hulls.
It's a shame that the Pegasus-class hydrofoils were ditched so early.

They could have landed all of the Harpoon canister launchers and turned those honies into go-fast boat hunter/killers.

I'd like to see the Dept. of Homeland Security reuse the retiring LHA ships as disaster response vessels. Two on each coast could support coast guard helo operations and put relief to shore pretty quickly.

They wouldn't need the major firepower, and they would make a good platform for deploying small boat teams to coast regions hard to reach by land after hurricanes.

That is an EXCELLENT idea. I know their triage and hospital facilities are second only to a full fledged hospital ship and they have the helicopter facilities for rapid medical transport as well as supporting rescue and recon ops. I worked on some improvements needed to the med facilities on those ships right after they were delivered from Ingalls. Not that Ingalls forgot to install them, just that they were late Shipalts with late funding that was not enough to cover Ingalls' Change Order charges. So the Navy yards got a crack at them instead.

They can carry 1200 Marines so that berthing area can be medical wards for patients with less than dire medical needs.

Communications spaces can be turned into a great 911 center to monitor and/or control dispatch of emergency personnel. Being a ship and if buoyed far enough off shore, cutting the moor and putting full power on the twin screws could allow the ship to ride on up and over an incoming tsunami. A major earthquake would only rattle a couple of small items off the shelves.

Only a direct hit from a locomotive sized asteroid could take it out.

Actually I'm rather surprised somebody hadn't snapped them up sooner.

The USN doesn't want/need them anymore and they're far too valuable (compared to a Spruance-class) as a saleable asset to smaller countries to be deep-sixed as quickly as the Spru-cans.

I know Australia was considering them (or had been offered them) and I think maybe Greece was mentioned as well.

It's too bad really, I've always like the Kidds. But those Mark 26's are just too passé I guess (no Tomahawk/Standard ER or later), what with the Baseline 0/1 Tico's getting decomm'ed. I wonder how long before a For Sale sign is hung on their bows. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/frown.gif"/>

Kidds were offer to Greece, but they didn't have the money to run 9000t destroyers. They opted for the Hydra class frigates.

The first 5 Ticos were offer to the Royal Navy as a stop gap measure to replace the retiring Type 42s, before the commissioning of the Type 45s. I guess they didn't want them because they want to spend as much money as possible on new hulls rather than rent old ones.

These Ticos should still be pretty good for many navies in the world. Too bad no one can afford them, or willing to afford them.

I didnt know that - interesting stuff. I can see why they rejected them, money being so tight for the RN, but in times that were more demanding, it would have been a sensible solution.

(Mind you, I would have retired the Type 42's in 1986, sold them to Brazil, and looked into building a UK version of the Burkes, with Aegis).

Great idea. But not sure what kind of shape they will be in when they get to retire.
I was on the Siapan 6 years ago and she was pretty beat up.

Maybe they could be transferred to the Fleet reserve or MSC. One last trip to the yard for refurbish. Preserve and seal off all the unnecessary spaces and have a Reserve/MM crew. Two per coast might be overkill though.

That wouldn't work. You don't understand our bureaucracy. Size and complexity of the government, along with inefficiency, can only go up, not down. That's a law.

In theory, the Department of Homeland Whatever merges Border Patrol, Coast Guard, INS, FBI, Barney Fife, and the rent-a-cops at the mall all into one lean mean law enforcement machine.

This couldn't be farther from the truth.

The inter agency rivalry is still there. Everyone is fighting for a bigger budget. The whole aparatus isn't any more efficient, just bigger, with an additional cabinet position along with all his support staff (Secratary of Homeland Security) on top of the chiefs already in place for those various agencies.

I have no idea how this can be fixed. All I can do is criticize.

She served well. Including being at Pearl during the raid. Alot of the U.S. cruisers (heavy &amp; light) IMO served well during WWII yes we had some losses (Indianapollis) and few others but overall I believed they served their needs for the time. My opinion... The Belgrano (ex Phoenix) should have never been there. Argentina should have known the Brits would have subs in the area having to come that distance to defend the Faulklands should have told Argentina the Brits would bring other toys to the game thus not go home "empty handed". Obviously they must have figured the Brits would only bring surface combatants. Its still debatable whether it was the right decision or not but what are you going to do when you are at war?.

Probably due to lighter, faster, easier and faster to deploy and probably as well store. Also another thought...The Zodiak doesnt sit as low in the water as a regular launch,barge or Capts gig.

Or this one which has much more signifigance to the British fleet. Again a gift from America's lend lease agreement of 50 destroyers for bases/air strips currently under British ownership.

DD - 131 Buchanan
Most widely known of the 50, Renamed HMS Campbeltown she was chosen for the raid on St. Nazaire France. Being disguised as a german destroyer and packed with explosives she was rammed into the gate of the Normandie Dry Dock in St. Nazaire and when the charges went off the dry dock gate was blown off and the dock was rendered unusable to the Germans.

The Normandie Dry Dock was the only dry dock outside of Germany that was large enough to accommodate the German Battleship Tirpitz, Keep her maintained and repaired for Atlantic Operations. As a result of the raid and destruction of the Campbeltown, the Tirpitz never left Norwegian waters and was never able to operate in the Atlantic. Campbeltown was destroyed in the raid on March 28 1942.

This photo taken just before detination on the sill of the Normany dry dock. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/>

HMS Venerable -&gt; sold to the Dutch and became the Karel Doorman. Which was then sold to the Argentinians and became the Veinticinco de Mayo. Another ship with a "few homes"... She would probably have been sunk by RN nuke subs had she not run back to port after the Belgrano... Second pic is of her as Veinticinco de Mayo (hence the colour)...

EDIT - should add that HMS Vengeance of the same class ended up as the Minas Gerais of Brazil via the RAN

And Warrior went to Argentina as well - via the RCN - as the Independencia.

LOL You dont have to tell me about how rough it gets on a Zod I know all to well. I would still opt for the launch when ferrying in open water. Atleast they have a small bow to break the rollers coming at you. Zods are more or less made for inland waters bays and rivers but certainly not for open ocean way too rough and I'm sure the Commadore didnt like the bath either. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>

The KIDD-class (also known as the SHAH-class) also differed from the SPUANCEs in that their sea-water inlet systems had a more advanced sand filtration system. They were designed to work in shallower water. I don't know if or how that affected their blue water capability.

Limitations aside, it is a pretty good suggestion, but it's not the first something like that has been made.

USNI Proceedings had an article similar to such during the Cold War of emergency aid ships that would be at sea during the missile exchange and then come back, afterwards. Since, in that scenario, repopulation would be an issue, mixed crews were part of the topic.

Actually, the British did announce that they were sending their 'nuclear subs' ahead of their surface fleet. This was done at the same time Britain announced the two hundred mile exclusion zone.
The biggest help to the Royal Navy was the satellite coverage supplied by the USA. The second greatest was the Sidewinder-9L missile and the Red Flag type exercise held with the French AF to determine the best way for Harrier pilots to deal with the Mirage-3.

</quote>

Comme ce, Comme ca. IMHO, two issues. First of all, there is a question of how hard they expected the Brits to fight for the island. "what are you going to do when you are at war?" Maybe they didn't expect the Brit's really to go to war. After all, maybe a lot of people didn't expect how far it would go. When the Sheffield was hit, one of the news magazine headlines was on the lines of "A little war turns nasty" (wtte).

Secondly, a primary belief in war, at least for some, is to make the other guy want to stop fighting. Obviously, if you kill him, that is accomplished. But more than that, it is to shock him to how bad war is, to make him go back to the negotiation table. That shock is known as THUNDERCLAP. Thunderclap might be, for example, nuking his leading city (maybe not the capital because you want the negotiation teams) on the first day of the war.

But sinking a high price item, such as a cruiser for such a country, is a version of THUNDERCLAP. You make the war VERY expensive for him.

Whether sinking the cruiser achieved the purpose of THUNDERCLAP is debateable. But it did accomplish one thing. Having lost the cruiser, they kept the carrier in port so not to chance losing it, too.

I purchased a computer online on 12/14/2007.  I live in Alaska but
wanted my daughter to pick up the computer and software in Wayne, New
Jersey.  My daughter teaches school in New Jersey and needed the
computer before the weekend so I thought she could pick it up at the
store.  I called Circuit City and got someone in manila (I asked) and
explained the situation.  They said it would be up to the store.  So I
tried to call the store and after going through about 6 of those press
this number or that I finally got someone that said to call back and
press 0 for customer service.  I called back and pressed 0 and got
some girl that put me on hold.  I called back again and asked for the
store manager and again was put on hold.  I called my daughter in New
Jersey and she said her Mom lived right next to the store and she
would try to pick up the computer.  So the next day (Saturday) I
called the store five times and five times customer service placed me
on hold or hung up.  My x-wife was at the store at the time and she
called me and said there was no way she could pick up the computer and
that I would have to cancel the order and wire her the money.  So I
cancelled the order and wired her $1400 using Western Union.  She
bought the computer using the very same order that I had done online.
The store tried to charge her $29 instead of the $19 on the order for
the wireless mouse and they left the Microsoft Office $149 software
out of the bag and she caught it so they then said they had forgotten
the software.
Now the bummer.  The original order was paid for by debit card and the
money was given to Circuit City as shown in my online bank record.  It
now has been 7 days and they still have my money for the canceled
order.  I called yesterday and again got some guy in Manila who said
the money for the canceled order would not go back into my bank
account for 2 to 5 business days and that they still have until
tomorrow, Friday to put the money back in.  Funny how they can
immediately take the money, but have to wait a week to put the money
back.  Do Not Buy From Circuit City!  I making this post all over the
Internet to teach these bums a lesson.

I used to have good experience with Circuit City. Last time, however, they
refused to accept VISA for a $100+ gadget without me showing them ID. &quot;For
your own protection&quot;, of course. Fine, turned around, drove to Best Buy,
purchased the gadget: some more or less knowledgeable assistance from the
staff; no attempts to &quot;protect&quot; me, not even a pressure to buy extended
warranty. Smooth transaction, as they say on ebay. With BB being constant
subject of beating in all consumer-orineted places, I was impressed. Called
Circuit City hq: yes, requesting the id is new policy in all CC stores,
during the xmas time.

Haptoglobin is degraded by iron in C57BL/6 mice: A possible link with
endoplasmic reticulum stress

Received 18 May 2007.  (Communicated by E. Beutler, M.D., 22 May
2007).  Available online 17 July 2007.

Abstract
Background
Haptoglobin is a glycoprotein produced mainly by the liver and
secreted into the circulation. Haptoglobin, by virtue of its high
affinity for hemoglobin, protects the tissues against hemoglobin-
induced oxidative damage and allows heme iron recycling. Haptoglobin
synthesis is controlled by various effectors, however, little is known
concerning its regulation by iron. Haptoglobin regulation in C57BL/6
and 129sv mice fed on an iron-rich diet for 3 weeks was thus
undertaken.

Results
Iron induced a dramatic post-transcriptional decrease of liver and
serum haptoglobin in C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, no alteration of
haptoglobin expression was detected in 129sv mice. We assumed that the
oxidative stress induced by iron in C57BL/6 mice altered the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) environment, leading to the incorrect
folding of haptoglobin and its subsequent degradation. To test this
hypothesis, the levels of the RE chaperone GRP78 were measured. This
chaperone is known to assist protein folding in the RE during
pathophysiological conditions. Interestingly, we found that the mRNA
and protein levels of GRP78 were decreased in iron-fed C57BL/6 mice,
while they were unchanged in iron-fed 129sv mice. These results
suggest that the correct processing of haptoglobin (glycosylation,
disulfide linkage, folding, and assembly) might be sensitive to ER
stress and that, in the absence of GRP78-mediated assistance, Hp is
degraded.

Conclusion
Our data demonstrate that iron regulates haptoglobin synthesis in
C57BL/6 mice and suggest a possible link with iron-induced ER stress.

I grabbed this little review off of Dime and thought some people,
especially TB would be interested in this.

If this story is true, it is pretty damn sad.

Van Halen
Meadowlands Izod Center
East Rutherford, New Jersey
United States of America
November 3, 2007

Notes: I was going to call this one &quot;Meltdown at the Meadowlands,&quot; but
after I heard the sound quality, not to mention the fact that it is
incomplete, I decided to pass on the formalities such as titles,
artwork, etc. The show is in the category of forgettable (or
unforgettable..depends how you look at things). I guess the high point
of the evening's drama was Eddie Van Halen stomping around like a 3-
year old because his guitar cable kept getting tangled (as he yanked
on it violently)...no wait...it would have to be him
screaming..SCREAMING at the tech guys on the side of the stage for the
better part of the show...no...the part where he flipped the monitor
over, because it was either too loud, or he didn't like what was
coming out of it..no...maybe it was when he picked said monitor up and
threw it across the stage...NO..I got it..it was when he proceeded to
pick up the monitor and throw it OFF the stage. That was it.

I'm not making any of this up.

There were some other noteworthy occurrences..like during one of Ed's
fits, where he was switching guitars..&quot;and the Cradle Will Rock&quot;
starts..only problem is..Ed is not holding a guitar..but it starts
nonetheless, with the swoosing flanged guitar..that's he's not
playing..it's pre-recorded..so is the rhythm part..I'm pretty sure
it's a keyboard, but I never noticed it, because he was usually
playing. This show seemed to measure up to the KC show everyone was
talking about..except Dave was great. I gained a newfound respect for
him tonight, as he was the consumate professional as his bandmate
stomped, sneared and screamed through 90% of the show, during which he
paid little attention to his playing, stopping at times, screwing up
at others. After the monitor toss, he pretty much threw and swatted at
anything and everything in his path.

I feel bad for Wolfie too. I can tell this is all getting to him fast.
He looked like he wanted to be ANYWHERE else for pretty much the
entire show. At times I caught him staring at Ed with this &quot;what the
f*ck??&quot; look on his face. At one point, after one of his meltdowns, I
guess Ed realized that yeh..there are like 10,000 people watching
this, he tried to do his goofy dancing and jumping pikes, then he goes
over to Wolfie's side and picks up a straw cowboy hat, puts it on,
then tries to put it on Wolf, only Wolfs backs up, slaps the hat away,
then proceeds to kick it off the stage into the crowd.

This thing is unravelling..fast. After the monitor throwing incident,
Ed came back up and looked almost possessed. Very sad indeed. Sad for
everyone involved. Sad for the fans that shelled out $500 to be in the
VIP circle. Actually, it was sad for any fan who shelled out even $1
to see this charade tonight. Saddest of all for the multi-millionaire
guitarist whose band is making 1.5 million per show that he can't put
everything aside for 2 hours a day, play his music and act like a
swell guy.

In any event..here it is. The recording matches the performance. BTW -
I'm not on the whole VH-bashing bandwagon either. I'm just really
disgusted at the show Ed turned in last night. I considered not going
to MSG next week, but figured I might as well, and hopefully go out on
a high note.

Watching a couple of Tom Petty shows recently...yeah, he still has a power
cable plugged into his guitar.
That's one reason (of many) why he's still the epitome of rock and roll
coolness....

I see it more often at festivals when they're running bands (and their

Coincidentally, I happened to listen to &quot;And The Cradle Will Rock&quot; on
headphones one day last week while walking the dog, and I had the mini-
revelation that that cool rhythm part does indeed sound like a treated/
overdriven keyboard. Pretty neat production trick lo those many years
ago.

Van Halen Meltdown is totally the name of my new band.

Just for the record, that's an audio cable, not a power cable, and
many, many bands still plug in.  Wireless technology is far from
perfect.  There's a thousand things that can go wrong, mostly
interference.  You've all seen it...no matter how much redundancy they
have, wireless mics go dead all the time.  And, the governement's been
screwing with frequency allocations lately, and that further
complicates the matter.

&gt; everything aside for 2 hours a day, play his music and act like a
&gt; swell guy.
">

Unfortunately, this guy's account is pretty much on the money, if a little
over dramatized.  There's already a clip on YouTube of the band's
performance of &quot;Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love&quot; from near the end of the show and
Eddie's guitar is drastically out of tune from banging it around during his
preceding solo spot and he just can't compensate with his diminished playing
skills:

http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ld4n_1Wwl9c

Note that at the very last second of the clip at the end of the song, Eddie
throws his guitar at or to his tech.

I can't say the tour is &quot;unraveling,&quot; as there's really been only two bum
shows so far, this one and the KC show a couple weeks ago.  However, there
*are* nagging problems mostly to do with very iffy arena sound and monitor
and guitar tuning issues pretty much revolving around Eddie  Take that into
account with the fact Eddie fired his regular guitar tech (who went online
on a guitar gear message board and hinted Eddie was impossible to work for)
only a couple weeks before the tour started makes me wonder if the current
tech is simply unable to cope with Eddie's undoubtedly difficult primadonna
music and personal issues or worse (or perhaps better, heh) is fucking with
Eddie on purpose just because Ed's such a prick to work for these days.

It is rather funny that the supposed weak links of this lineup, being Roth
and Eddie's young son have more than surpassed any expectations while Eddie
just can't seem to consistently keep it together onstage.

I've seen hundreds of bands, many shows in every sort of venue possible and
it simply appears Eddie and by virtue the band is having an unprecedented
amount of sound issues from monitors, to earpiece volume to amps to his
guitar being constantly out of tune compared to anyone else I've ever seen
including Van Halen up through '98 and it actually appears to be getting
worse, not better on a show by show basis.  One band whom I've seen have a
lot of guitar issues live, U2, always has The Edge's guitar tech right there
with a new guitar if Edge breaks a string or has a instrument problem. It's
astounding Eddie Van Halen is going night after night with these sort of
problems through big chunks of the show.

Regarding the guitar cable issue many people wonder about, yeah, a lot of
musicians still use cables for a variety of reasons, one being wireless
technology is far from sonically perfect (although in a huge arena, no one
could probably notice the difference, especially concerning Eddie's tone
which is pretty harsh and ratty these days), plus the transmitter/receiver
can pick up interference or outside broadcasts (see the infamous scene in
&quot;Spinal Tap&quot;) especially outdoors.  The thing is, a guy like Eddie who moves
all over the stage and is constantly tripping over and fiddling with the
cable, he really should be wireless and in fact, always was up until 1998
and his tone never suffered live - in fact it sounds worse the past couple
tours than it ever has. Being chained to a cable, he doesn't go out on the
ramp at all and is pretty much limited to his 25 feet of space around his
rig.

I'm going to the first show at Staples Arena in LA on 11/20, and have a 5th
row seat right on Eddie's side like the unrepentant VH nerdliner I still am.
It's tough to say which I'm looking forward to more, this lineup playing the
songs from the first 6 albums or a true onstage meltdown of Chernobyl sized
proportions.  To be fair, when I saw the mediocre Sammy Hagar reunion in
'04, that tour was getting slammed because Eddie was absolutely wasted on
stage at most shows and they wound up turning in one of the most solid shows
of the tour at the Staples show I caught. Thus it's fair to assume they'll
bring their &quot;A&quot; game to LA for the hometown crowd which I expect will
welcome these guys like conquering heroes.

You can't see him actually throwing the wedge monitor off the stage but you
can see the buildup where he's clearly yelling and gesturing to his tech(s)
off stage and eventually drags his monitor towards the end of the stage:

&gt;You can't see him actually throwing the wedge monitor off the stage but you
&gt;can see the buildup where he's clearly yelling and gesturing to his tech(s)
&gt;off stage and eventually drags his monitor towards the end of the stage:

Here's a musical meltdown that occurred early in the tour during their
encore of &quot;Jump&quot;
from the Greensboro, NC show. Listen how out of tune Eddie's guitar
was with their
pre-recorded synth part.  I'm surprised he didn't throw something
then.

March 25, 1961 found Elvis at the Bloch Arena at Pearl Harbor. His performance and support raised money and awareness which enabled the USS Arizona Memorial to be completed the following year. This was Elvis’ last live, non-movie performance until his 1968 television special.

No, it ain't me. Sounds like it's you.

31 ¶ Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy [against] the [Holy] Ghost shall not be
forgiven unto men.

(New Testament | Matthew 12:31)

&quot;He that doth evil, let him do evil still: and he which is filthy, let him
be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be *MORE* righteous:
and he that is holy, let him be *MORE* holy.&quot;

~~Revelation 22:11 (1534 Tyndale translation)

&quot;He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him
be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and
he that is holy, let him be holy still.&quot;

~~Revelation 22:11 (1611 King James Version)

34 And wo be unto him that will not hearken unto the words of Jesus, and
also to them whom he hath chosen and sent among them; for whoso receiveth
not the words of Jesus and the words of those whom he hath sent receiveth
not him; and therefore he will not receive them at the last day;

35 And it would be better for them if they had not been born. For do ye
suppose that ye can get rid of the justice of an offended God, who hath been
trampled under feet of men, that thereby salvation might come?

(Book of Mormon | 3 Nephi 28:34 - 35)

5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the
heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the
water:

6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:

7 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in
store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of
ungodly men.

(New Testament | 2 Peter 3:5 - 7)

6 Yea, wo unto him that shall deny the revelations of the Lord, and that
shall say the Lord no longer worketh by revelation, or by prophecy, or by
gifts, or by tongues, or by healings, or by the power of the Holy Ghost!

7 Yea, and wo unto him that shall say at that day, to get gain, that there
can be no miracle wrought by Jesus Christ; for he that doeth this shall
become like unto the son of perdition, for whom there was no mercy,
according to the word of Christ!

8 Yea, and ye need not any longer hiss, nor spurn, nor make game of the
Jews, nor any of the remnant of the house of Israel; for behold, the Lord
remembereth his covenant unto them, and he will do unto them according to
that which he hath sworn.

(Book of Mormon | 3 Nephi 29:6 - 8)

29 For where is the disputer that there is a God in that day which shall
burn, even as an oven, saith the Lord?

30 Now of these things, ye must judge.

31 For it is that by what judgment, saith the Lord, that a man judgeth, that
he shall also be judged, and it shall be unto every man, even according to
his work.

Revelations of Jesus Christ 8:29-31

&quot;Judgment [of God is] according to opportunity for acquiring truth.&quot;

~~Art Bulla, Apostle of Jesus Christ

3 And it is that this death cometh upon all those who deny me and
*PERSIST* therein and who will not repent, neither can they, saith
the Lord God of Israel who it is that doth speak unto thee, O man,
whom I the Lord God have created in mine own image, even in the
image of mine Only Begotten Son have I created thee.

Revelations of Jesus Christ 43:3

30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance [belongeth] unto me, I will
recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.

31 [It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

(New Testament | Hebrews 10:30 - 31)

13 And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of the wicked, yea, who
are evil--for behold, they have no part nor portion of the Spirit of the
Lord; for behold, they chose evil works rather than good; therefore the
spirit of the devil did enter into them, and take possession of their
house--and these shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be
weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, and this because of their own
iniquity, being led captive by the will of the devil.

14 Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked, yea, in darkness,
and a state of awful, fearful looking for the fiery indignation of the
wrath of God upon them; thus they remain in this state, as well as
the righteous in paradise, until the time of their resurrection.

(Book of Mormon | Alma 40:13 - 14)

20 For it was that them before the flood obtained promise of deliverance
in the resurrection from hell, which shall not be given unto this
generation, saith the Lord, for thou hast also blasphemed against
the Holy Ghost, O liberal man and woman, which they did not do before
the flood.

Revelations of Jesus Christ 24:20

I didn't cast no spell on Norman Mailer either. Yea, thus saith the Lord of
hosts, Mailer did it to himself. (10:32 pm, Nov 13, 2007)

Norman Mailer Passes at 84

With great sorrow, the family of Norman Mailer announces his passing
on November 10, at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City. The cause was
acute renal failure. He was eighty four.

Mailer resided in Provincetown, Massachusetts, with his wife of 33 years,
Norris Church Mailer, and maintained an apartment in Brooklyn, New York.

He was the author of more than 30 books, the director of four films, and
a co-founder of the Village Voice. He ran for mayor of New York in the
1969 Democratic primary, and was a member of the American Institute of
Arts and Letters. He won many literary awards, including two Pulitzers and
the National Book Award.

His latest book, *On God: an Uncommon Conversation*, was
published on October 16th.

*On God: an Uncommon Conversation* (2007),
by Norman Mailer, with Michael Lennon:

Norman Mailer:
Oh, Christ, Mike, I don't think in these formulae. I want to get to
something more basic to my thought, which is that much of the world's
present-day cosmology is based on such works of revelation as the Old and
New Testament, or the Koran, yet for me Revelation is itself the question
mark. Revelation, after all, is not God's words but ours, words debated back
then, if you will, in committee and assembled by working theologians with
varying agendas. After all, why would God bother to speak in such a fashion?
There's no need. God could have imparted such thoughts directly to us.
Revelation has always struck me as a power trip for high priests who were
looking to create a product that would enable them to lead their flock more
securely, more emphatically. Their modern-day practitioners quote constantly
from Scripture on TV, use it as their guide rail, and run into intolerable
contradictions that are guaranteed to cripple their power to reason. I will
go so far as to say that to be a Fundamentalist is to exist as a human whose
reasoning powers have been degraded into inanition before any question for
which a Fundamentalist does not already have an answer.

I confess, then, that I feel no attachment whatsoever to organized religion.
I see God, rather, as a Creator, as the greatest artist. I see human beings
as His most developed artworks. I also see animals as His artworks. When I
think of evolution, what stands out most is the drama that went on in God as
an artist. Successes were also marred by failures. I think of all the errors
He made in evolution as well as of the successes. In marine life, for
example, some fish have hideous eyes -- they protrude from the head in tubes
many inches long. Think of all those animals of the past with their peculiar
ugliness, their misshapen bodies, worm life, frog life, vermin life, that
myriad of insects -- so many unsuccessful experiments. These were also modes

the Artist was trying -- this great artist, this divine artist -- to express
something incredible, and it was not, for certain, an easy process. Indeed,
it went on forever! I would guess that evolution was tampered with, if not
actually blindsided on occasion, by the Devil. I think there were false
trips that God engaged in because the Devil deluded Him -- or Her. Forgive
me if I keep speaking of God as &quot;Him,&quot; that's a habit that's come down to me
from Revelation. Obviously, to speak of God as &quot;Her&quot; is off-putting, but to
speak of &quot;Him/Her&quot; or &quot;It&quot; is worse.

In any event, it makes sense to me that this strife between God and the
Devil has been a factor in evolution. Whether God had a free hand or the
Devil was meddling in it from the commencement -- either way, some species
were badly conceived. Sometimes a young artist has to make large errors
before he or she can go farther.

14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou
[art] cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy
belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:

(Old Testament | Genesis 3:14)

Every man upon the earth, professing Christians or non-professing, must hear
it, and will know it sooner or later.  They came here, organized the raw
material, and arranged in their order the herbs of the field, the trees, the
apple, the peach, the plum, the pear, and every other fruit that is
desirable and good for man; the seed was brought from another sphere, and
planted in this earth.  The thistle, and thorn, the brier, and the obnoxious
weed did not appear until after the earth was cursed.  When Adam and Eve had
eaten of the forbidden fruit, their bodies became mortal from its effects,
and therefore their offspring were mortal.

~~Journal of Discourses, Vol.1, Pg.50, Brigham Young, April 9, 1852

Two men say they're Jesus one of them must be wrong
How come Jesus gets industrial disease?

Family files claim against CPS for toddler's death
By Crystal Carreon - ccarr ... @sacbee.com

Published 6:54 pm PDT Friday, October 26, 2007

http://www.sacbee.com/101/story/456452.html

Tamekca Walker, 34, was arraigned Friday in Sacramento County Superior
Court on charges of felony assault resulting in the death of a child and
the murder of Tamaihia Lynae Moore.

Walker did not enter a plea.

Tamaihia, who was placed in Walker's south Sacramento home last month,
died on Monday. The cause of her death has not been determined.

But outside of the courtroom, Debra Oliver, the child's grandmother,
accused the county's Child Protective Services of being negligent in
Tamaihia's care and culpable in her death.

The toddler's family filed a wrongful death claim Friday against
Sacramento County as a precursor to a lawsuit.

&quot;They didn't do their job,&quot; Oliver said, as others close to the family
fought back tears. &quot;CPS can't say they're not at fault.&quot;

CURRENTLY CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES VIOLATES MORE CIVIL RIGHTS ON A
DAILY BASIS THEN ALL OTHER AGENCIES COMBINED INCLUDING THE NSA / CIA
WIRETAPPING PROGRAM....

CPS Does not protect children...
It is sickening how many children are subject to abuse, neglect and even
killed at the hands of Child Protective Services.

every parent should read this .pdf from
connecticut dcf watch...

http://www.connecticutdcfwatch.com/8x11.pdf

http://www.connecticutdcfwatch.com

Number of Cases per 100,000 children in the US
These numbers come from The National Center on
Child Abuse and Neglect in Washington. (NCCAN)
Recent numbers have increased significantly for CPS

*Perpetrators of Maltreatment*

Physical Abuse CPS 160, Parents 59
Sexual Abuse CPS 112, Parents 13
Neglect CPS 410, Parents 241
Medical Neglect CPS 14 Parents 12
Fatalities CPS 6.4, Parents 1.5

Imagine that, 6.4 children die at the hands of the very agencies that
are supposed to protect them and only 1.5 at the hands of parents per
100,000 children. CPS perpetrates more abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse
and kills more children then parents in the United States. If the
citizens of this country hold CPS to the same standards that they hold
parents too. No judge should ever put another child in the hands of ANY
government agency because CPS nationwide is guilty of more harm and
death than any human being combined. CPS nationwide is guilty of more
human rights violations and deaths of children then the homes from which
they were removed. When are the judges going to wake up and see that
they are sending children to their death and a life of abuse when
children are removed from safe homes based on the mere opinion of a
bunch of social workers.

CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES, HAPPILY DESTROYING THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT
FAMILIES YEARLY NATIONWIDE AND COMING TO YOU'RE HOME SOON...

BE SURE TO FIND OUT WHERE YOUR CANDIDATES STANDS ON THE ISSUE OF
REFORMING OR ABOLISHING CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES (&quot;MAKE YOUR CANDIDATES
TAKE A STAND ON THIS ISSUE.&quot;) THEN REMEMBER TO VOTE ACCORDINGLY IF THEY
ARE &quot;FAMILY UNFRIENDLY&quot; IN THE NEXT ELECTION...

The University of Heloise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are three things Heloise wants you to know before you go off to
college:
</P>
<P>
1. Vacuuming sheets and spraying them with Febreze is not as effective
as washing them with soap and water.
</P>
<P>
2. Black nail polish hides scratches on your iPhone case.
</P>
<P>
3. If you drop your cellphone in the toilet, take out the battery, then
blot the phone with a towel and blow-dry.
</P>
<P>
In the next few weeks, 18.4 million college students will begin their
fall semester, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Some will be
living away from home for the first time. A number will arrive with shoe
organizers, 400-thread-count extra-long twin sheets and a spotless
mini-fridge. Others will crash in sleeping bags and use their grody room
piled with sweaty spandex mainly as a charging station. You know who you
are.
</P>
<P>
Enter Heloise, the syndicated columnist and dispenser of practical
household advice who goes by only one name, even on her American Express
card. She's been paying particular attention to campus living and has been
speaking at colleges. As she brainstorms with students nationwide, she finds
a hunger for wisdom on sharing spaces and wrinkle-free living. Last month,
she drove an hour north from her ranch house in San Antonio to her alma
mater, Texas State University at San Marcos, to listen and advise.
</P>
<P>
And yes, she's heard the stories about the guy who cleans his CDs by
placing them in the toilet bowl and flushing, and the girl who burned her
delicates to a crisp on high in the clothes dryer.
</P>
<P>
"I learn from students and I challenge them," says Heloise, 58, who took
over the family hints business when her mother, also named Heloise, died in
1977. Her column "Hints From Heloise" appears in more than 350 newspapers,
and she has written 11 books on lifestyle tips.
</P>
<P>
Students these days "have more technology and they're constantly
communicating on Facebook and Twitter, but human nature doesn't change over
the decades," she says. "They are still kids going off to college who may
never have shared a bathroom." But they already have established cleaning
habits, such as licking their DVDs clean. (Hint: Use a microfiber
cloth.)
</P>
<P>
Here's a typical question she gets via e-mail from a college student:
"Dear Heloise: I get in the shower with my T-shirt on and lather up and then
rinse it off and hang it on a hanger. The next day it's dry and clean. Do
you think this is a good way to do laundry?" This one's not posted on her
Web site.
</P>
<P>
Students do wacky things. But so does Heloise, who has advocated
quick-drying underwear in a salad spinner. She has spent her career
educating readers about the nuts and bolts of daily living, and she can
deduce from the e-mail questions she receives that many members of this
generation of college students grew up with working parents who didn't have
time to teach their kids basic skills.
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, these kids are the privileged generation," she says.
"They get the best, they've had their own private bedrooms, they don't leave
a sporting event without a trophy. But they still need life skills."
</P>
<P>
Heloise starts her one-hour presentation at Texas State -- to high school
and college students participating in the Texas Mathworks summer camp -- with
a fitted-sheet folding contest and a discussion about getting along with
roommates. Most of the students had never heard of her. But Eunice Alade, a
16-year-old from Cincinnati, says she was already signed up for Heloise's
daily e-mail tips. "I just learned that you should put the water in the
washing machine before you put in the bleach," says Alade.
</P>
<P>
"College is the place you learn to get along," says Heloise. "You will
work your whole life with people you didn't choose. In college, you learn to
work things out."
</P>
<P>
Later at a round-table discussion, students ask Heloise for help with
one of her specialties: stains.
</P>
<P>
Wesley Chen, 19, of Pasadena, Calif., found bleached-out spots on his
clothes. "I'm afraid they might be coming from the acne cream with hydrogen
peroxide," he says. Heloise confirms that this was a bleaching agent.
"Because the color has been removed, that is bad news," she says. On jeans,
she advises, a small spot can be covered up using a felt-tip
marker.
</P>
<P>
Toothpaste smeared on black pants is the fashion emergency of Karen
Vazquez, 21, of McAllen, Texas. "I'm not very happy about it. And I don't
want to wash them with my jeans in case it rubs off on them," says Vazquez.
The Heloise hint: Rub some cheap shampoo on the back of the stain, turn the
jeans inside out and launder them. Then air-dry; don't put them in the
dryer.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Hsiau, 24, of St. Louis wonders about "business casual." "I never
know what this means," he says.
</P>
<P>
"It depends on what part of the country you are in," says Heloise. "It
could be nice jeans and a starched shirt. In the banking world it could be
khakis. I'd say it means no flip-flops or cleavage. Call someone who has
been before or simply call up the people giving the event."
</P>
<P>
The 103-degree day ends with a visit to the College Inn, the dorm where
Heloise lived as a freshman in 1969. By some karmic twist, summer school
student Matthew Rydell, 20, of San Antonio was placed in her former
residence, Room 360. He seems to have channeled a bit of Heloise.
</P>
<P>
The room is furnished mainly with technology: a TV, laptop, PlayStation
3, cellphone and iPod. But in the walk-in closet next to his golf clubs and
case of Diet Mountain Dew, his neat row of hanging, spanking-clean polo
shirts shows he has mastered laundry. "I take them out wet from the washer
and dry them on hangers," explains Rydell.
</P>
<P>
"The weight stretches the wrinkles out of them," says Heloise. "Not
bad."

      INTERNATIONAL ("i" code)

      NKOREA-U.S. (Washington) -- Looking at the state of North
Korea-U.S. relations after the trip by former President Bill
Clinton to win the release of two journalists. By Mark Landler.

      With:

      NKOREA-JOURNALISTS (Los Angeles) -- Former President Bill Clinton
arrived in the United States Wednesday morning after a dramatic
20-hour visit to North Korea, in which he won the freedom of two
American journalists, opened a diplomatic channel to North Korea's
reclusive government and dined with the North's ailing leader, Kim
Jong Il. By Jennifer Steinhauer.

      IRAQ (Baghdad) -- Prime Minister Nouri Kamel el-Maliki on
Wednesday ordered the removal of concrete barriers in Baghdad. By
Sam Dagher.

      PAKISTAN-TALIBAN (Islamabad) -- Four people, including a wife of
the Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud, were killed
Wednesday by what local residents said was a missile strike from a
remotely piloted American aircraft. The missile struck a house in
the remote Zanghra village in South Waziristan about 1 a.m.
Wednesday. Local residents reached by telephone confirmed that one
of the wives of Mehsud, the leader of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan,
was among those killed. Her name or age could not be confirmed.
Five others, including four children, were reportedly wounded in
the missile strike. By Pir Zubair Shah and Salman Masood.

      AFGHAN-VIOLENCE (Kabul) -- Six civilians were killed Wednesday by
a roadside bomb that bore the hallmarks of Taliban militants, while
American forces killed four people in southern Afghanistan who
residents said were also civilians. By Dexter Filkins.

      IRAN (Beirut) -- With his adversaries shunning the ceremony and
security forces on the streets, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was
sworn into office for a second term Wednesday, almost two months
after elections that divided the nation and sparked Iran's deepest
crisis since the Islamic revolution 30 years ago. By Robert F.
Worth.

      JAPAN-POLITICS (Matsuyama, Japan) -- The collapse of the
long-governing Liberal Democratic Party's base in the countryside
appears to be sending the party to a humiliating loss in the Aug.
30 national elections, which would knock them out of power for only
the second time since the party's founding in 1955. By Martin
Fackler.

      POPE-RECORD-DEAL (Undated) -- The pope has signed with Geffen
records for an album of him chanting and saying liturgy. By Daniel
J. Wakin.

      AFRICA-CLINTON (Nairobi, Kenya) -- Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton opened her seven-nation African tour in Kenya with
an address to a major U.S.-African trade conference and other
public events on Wednesday, in a visit intended to promote the
broad themes of good government, trade, food security and women's
rights. But Wednesday's events were shadowed by a subject of deep
international concern: Kenya's volatile politics. By Jeffrey
Gettleman.

      BRAZIL-SENATE-CORRUPT (Brasilia, Brazil) -- The pressure is
mounting on Jose Sarney, the president of Brazil's senate, to
resign his post amid corruption allegations. The departure of
Sarney, who heads the PMDB party and is a former Brazilian
president, could affect President Lula's majority coalition in the
senate, hampering the popular leader's ability to push through his
legislative agenda in his last year in office. Analysts and
opposition senators believe that controversial legislation to
redefine the country's oil industry could be in jeopardy. Some
senators have defined the struggle over Sarney as emblematic of an
aging generation of Brazilian politicians that abused their
positions to enrich themselves and family members. Sarney said
Tuesday that he would speak in his own defense on Wednesday on the
senate floor. By Alexei Barrionuevo.

      CHINA-CLIMATE (Beijing) -- China's envoy to global negotiations
on climate change expressed optimism on Wednesday that a new
agreement to reduce greenhouse gases will be reached this year, and
said that his nation's efforts to curb carbon pollution already had
produced results that he called "second to none." By Michael
Wines.

      CHINA-QUAKE-TRIALS (Beijing) -- Human rights advocates are
calling on the Chinese government to cancel the criminal trials of
two men who pushed for official investigations into the causes of
widespread school collapses during the devastating 2008 earthquake
in western China. The trial of one of the men began on Wednesday
but adjourned without a verdict. By Edward Wong.

      PHILIPPINES-AQUINO (Manila, Philippines) -- In a reminder of the
"people power" outpourings she inspired more than 20 years ago,
more than 100,000 people thronged the streets of Manila as the body
of former President Corazon C. Aquino was driven slowly through
swirling winds and rain for burial on Wednesday. For five days
after Aquino, 76, died of cancer on Saturday, crowds of mourners
converged on her coffin as it passed through the streets and lay in
state at Manila Cathedral. The banners, the tears, the clouds of
yellow confetti and the familiar chant of her name -- "Cory! Cory!
Cory!" -- went beyond mourning to political statement, as the
Philippines continues to wrestle with the democratic processes she
restored when she came to power in 1986. By Seth Mydans.

      SKOREA-AUTOS-RAID (Seoul, South Korea) -- South Korean police
commandos stormed a car factory on Wednesday using helicopters,
water cannons and tear gas in what the authorities hoped would be a
final push to evict hundreds of workers who seized the plant more
than two months ago to protest layoffs. But the workers who
remained holed up in the factory, the Ssangyong Motor Co. plant in
Pyeongtaek, 37 miles south of Seoul, refused to surrender, warning
that further police action could ignite thousands of liters of
paint thinner and other materials. By Choe- Sang-hun.

      NATIONAL GENERAL ("a" code)

      PA-GYM-SHOOTING (Bridgeville, Pa.) -- The man who opened fire in
a busy fitness center Tuesday evening, killing three women before
committing suicide, had planned the attack for months because of
frustration over his inability to find a girlfriend, according to a
diary he posted online. Two law enforcement officials confirmed
reports that the gunman was George Sodini, 48, of Scott Township, a
Pittsburgh suburb, and they said the diary appeared to be
legitimate, based on its contents. By Sean D. Hamill.

      U.S.-BIRTH-RATE (Undated) -- For the first time since the decade
started, Americans are having fewer babies and some experts are
blaming the recession. In 2006, the number of births in the United
States nearly tied a 45-year-old record high, set near the end of
the baby boom. Even more babies were born in 2007. But in 2008,
births began to decline nationwide, by nearly 2 percent, according
to provisional figures released last week. And this year, as more
families were feeling the effects of the recession, the earliest
monthly figures suggest that births decreased even faster. In the
first six months of 2009, 7 percent fewer babies were born compared
to the year before in Arizona, where the jobless rate rose from 5.5
percent to 8.7 percent in the year ending in June. By Sam Roberts.

      MASS-ADAMS-DIARIES (Boston) -- John Quincy Adams, president,
statesman and-- twitterer? The Massachusetts Historical Society on
Wednesday began posting snippets of the fifth president's diaries
on Twitter after a graduate student commented that they look like
today's tweets. By Katie Zezima.

      WASHINGTON ("w" code)

      OBAMA-DEM-GOVS (Washington) -- President Barack Obama heads to
Virginia on Thursday to make his first campaign stop on behalf of
R. Creigh Deeds, the gubernatorial candidate trying to keep the
state in the Democratic column. Earlier this week, Obama appeared
in a television advertisement of Gov. Jon Corzine, the New Jersey
Democrat who is struggling to win a second term. The Virginia and
New Jersey gubernatorial races are only big-ticket political
contests for 2009, so it was no doubt inevitable that they are now
being examined as an early measure of how Obama is doing, and a
sign of how Democrats might do in 2010. And while history suggests
off-year elections tend to be overanalyzed, the confluence of these
two contests is creating is creating a political dynamic that is
posing complications for the White House and potential headaches
for Democrats going into 2010. By Adam Nagourney.

      HEALTHCARE-REFORM (Washington) -- Daily developments. By Robert
Pear and David M. Herszenhorn.

      U.S.-SPACE-FUTURE (Washington) -- After listening to pleas from
space enthusiasts, a blue-ribbon panel reviewing the United States'
human spaceflight program started hashing out possible compromises
needed to fit out-of-this-world aspirations into a tight budget
box. By Kenneth Chang.

      FINANCIAL ("f" code)

      ECON-RDP (Undated) -- Two big sectors of the U.S. economy were
heading in opposite directions even as the recession showed signs
of nearing a bottom, economic figures released Wednesday indicated.
Manufacturers demonstrated some strength in June, as orders and
shipments for goods like metals, construction machinery, turbines
and electrical equipment posted a surprising increase, according to
new government numbers. But the country's service sector weakened
in July as new orders sagged and employment conditions worsened,
according to a private group's assessment. By Jack Healy.

      GOLDMAN-COMEBACK (New York) -- Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive
of Goldman Sachs, frequently tells the story about what happened
last fall like this: the flood of the century hit Wall Street and
Bear Stearns was on the first floor, Lehman Brothers on the second,
Merrill Lynch on the third, Morgan Stanley on the fourth and
Goldman on the fifth. The bottom floors were wiped out. The top
floors would have faced the same fate except for the fact that
someone stopped the flood. "It was a question of when the water
would stop rising," said two people who have heard the same story
from Blankfein. To most observers, that "someone" was the
government. By allowing Goldman and Morgan to become bank holding
companies, which gave them access to funds from the Federal Reserve
Bank and later, the ability to issue debt guaranteed by the
government, the government saved the two firms from collapse. Nine
months later, much of Wall Street is still reeling from the effects
of the storm. Goldman is not. By Jenny Anderson.

      HEALTHCARE-STANDARDS (Undated) -- The Obama administration and
lawmakers are urging a common-sense cure for the nation's faltering
health care system: persuading doctors to standardize how they
treat patients by using guidelines based on medical evidence. In
recent years, many insurers and health plans have adopted a similar
strategy, even paying bonuses in some cases to doctors who meet
standards like controlling blood-pressure or cholesterol. The basic
idea is that optimal treatment of these conditions will save money
by preventing serious disease. But while it may sound simple, the
strategy poses potentially serious difficulties that have not been
discussed much in this year's debate in Washington. In particular,
history suggests that it will not be easy to come up with
guidelines for doctors that are firmly grounded in scientific
research and that ultimately do more good than harm. Consider what
happened to one benchmark used in the treatment of diabetes, one of
the nation's most serious medical problems, and one of its most
thoroughly researched. By Barry Meier.

      CHINA-U.S.-EXPATS (Beijing) -- Shanghai and Beijing are becoming
new lands of opportunity for recent American college graduates who
face unemployment nearing double digits at home. Even those with
limited or no knowledge of Chinese are heeding the call. They are
lured by China's surging economy, the lower cost of living, and a
chance to bypass some of the dues-paying common to first jobs in
the United States. By Hannah Seligson.

      CISCO-EARNINGS (Undated) -- Cisco is to post its fiscal
fourth-quarter results after the market closes. By Ashlee Vance.

      NEWS-CORP-EARNINGS (Undated) -- News Corp. is to reports its
fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market closes. By Tim
Arango.

      EXP-NKOREA-U.S. (Washington) -- A day after former President Bill
Clinton's foray into North Korea to win the freedom of two American
journalists, the Obama administration moved quickly to send a stern
message to the North Korean regime. President Barack Obama said
Clinton's "humanitarian mission" did not ease the demands of the
United States and his allies that North Korea alter its behavior if
it wants to escape its isolation. By Mark Landler.

      EXP-SKOREA-AUTOS-RAID (Seoul, South Korea) -- South Korean police
commandos stormed a car factory using helicopters, water cannons
and tear gas in what the authorities hoped would be a final push to
evict hundreds of workers who seized the plant more than two months
ago to protest layoffs. But the workers who remained holed up in
the factory, the Ssangyong Motor Co. plant, refused to surrender,
warning that further police action could ignite thousands of liters
of paint thinner and other materials. By Choe- Sang-hun.

      EXP-DIGITAL-STATISTICIANS (Palo Alto, Calif.) -- At Harvard,
Carrie Grimes majored in archaeology and studied Mayan settlement
patterns. But she was drawn to what she called "all the computer
and math stuff" that was part of the job. She now works at Google,
using statistical analyses of mounds of data to come up with ways
to improve its search engine. Grimes is one of the Internet-age
statisticians who are changing the image of the profession as a
place for dronish number nerds. By Steve Lohr.

      EXP-GOLF-WATER-CONSERVE (Atlanta) -- Mindful that global warming
could provoke more and longer dry spells, state governments are
increasingly consulting golf courses on water strategies. In
Georgia, golf course managers have emerged as go-to gurus on water
conservation for both industries and nonprofit groups. By Leslie
Kaufman.

      EXP-BANKS-REGULATE (Washington) -- If President Barack Obama's
proposals to overhaul financial regulation fail in Congress, they
will largely be a casualty of the resistance to central elements of
the plan by his own regulators, who in turn reflect the views of
the banking industry segments they supervise. In what has become a
routine spectacle, the top regulators on Tuesday again challenged
major portions of the proposal at a congressional hearing. By
Stephen Labaton.

      EXP-IRAN (Beirut) -- With his adversaries shunning the ceremony
and security forces on the streets, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
was sworn into office for a second term on Wednesday, almost two
months after elections that divided the nation and sparked Iran's
deepest crisis since the Islamic revolution 30 years ago. By Robert
F. Worth.

      EXP-JAPAN-POLITICS (Matsuyama, Japan) -- The collapse of the
long-governing Liberal Democratic Party's base in the countryside
appears to be sending the party toward a humiliating loss in the
Aug. 30 national elections, which would knock them out of power for
only the second time since1955. By Martin Fackler.

      EXP-CAR-BATTERY-GRANTS (Washington) -- Seeking to put the nation
back in the lead on an important technology, the Obama
administration is awarding more than $2 billion in grants for
advanced battery manufacturing, mostly for electric cars. They are
meant to help companies scale up large-scale manufacturing lines
for modern batteries of the sort now mostly made in Asia. By
Matthew L. Wald.

      EXP-CHINA-U.S.-EXPATS (Beijing) -- Shanghai and Beijing are
becoming new lands of opportunity for recent American college

in a busy fitness center, killing three women before committing
suicide, had planned the attack for months because of frustration

posted online. Two law enforcement officials confirmed reports that
the gunman was George Sodini, 48, of Scott Township, and they said
the diary appeared to be legitimate. By Sean D. Hamill.

GUNMAN DREW DARK PORTRAIT OF LONELINESS BEFORE SHOOTING WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BRIDGEVILLE, Pa.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tortured by loneliness and his lack of
success with women, George Sodini developed a plan to get even. On
Tuesday night, he executed it, opening fire in a fitness center
here and hitting 12 women, three fatally, before turning a gun on
himself.
</P>
<P>
Sodini, 48, described his anger and frustration in painstaking
detail in notes he carried with him and left at his home and in a
chilling online diary, offering an extraordinarily stark portrait
of a killer's motives. Officials said Sodini, of Scott Township, a
suburb about six miles southwest of Pittsburgh, prepared for the
assault for at least nine months, buying ammunition and at least
three guns and making practice runs to the fitness center.
</P>
<P>
By the time he killed himself with a shot to his head a minute
after the attack began, Sodini, who had no prior criminal record or
known history of mental illness, had fired at least 36 shots from
two 9 mm semi-automatic weapons, but never fully emptied either of
the 30-round clips on the guns, or reloaded with the two full clips
found in his bag.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know why he stopped shooting, just thank God that he
did," said Charles Moffatt, the superintendent of the Allegheny
County Police Department, which is leading the investigation. "He
just had a lot of hatred in him and he was hell bent on doing this
act."
</P>
<P>
Of the nine injured women, three of them were still in serious
condition on Wednesday at a local hospital, Moffatt said.
</P>
<P>
In his online journal, which has since been taken off the
Internet, Sodini, a programmer-analyst at a local law firm, said
that he had not had a girlfriend since 1984 and that he had not had
sex since July 1990, when he was 29.
</P>
<P>
"I actually look good," Sodini wrote in an entry dated Dec.
29, 2008. "I dress good, am clean-shaven, bathe, touch of cologne
-- yet 30 million women rejected me -- over an 18- or 25-year period.
That is how I see it. Thirty million is my rough guesstimate of how
many desirable single women there are.
</P>
<P>
"A man needs a woman for confidence. He gets a boost on the
job, career, with other men, and everywhere else when he knows
inside he has someone to spend the night with and who is also a
friend."
</P>
<P>
At some point on Monday, Sodini updated his diary with his
intention to finally go through with the attack -- after he
"chickened out" on another Tuesday in January -- and he included
his birth date and date of death: 8/4/2009.
</P>
<P>
Sodini's writings and rationale are all too familiar, said Dr.
Michael Welner, a forensic psychiatrist and adjunct law professor
at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, who has studied mass
murderers.
</P>
<P>
"Mass shooters aim for the attention and notoriety of other
mass shooters," he said. "If you read this blog, it may explain
to the reader why he feels hopeless, but it doesn't explain why he
decides to take the lives of innocent strangers, which is the
point. He's channeling that sense of masculine, sexual failure into
a conquest that results in a mass killing."
</P>
<P>
The attack took place in a "Latin Impact" aerobics class with
about 22 women in it on Tuesday at about 8:15 p.m. at an LA Fitness
center in a shopping center in Collier Township, about 12 miles
southwest of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
Moffatt said Sodini had not known anyone in the class, and chose
it simply because it had a lot of women in it. Dressed in a black
headband and black workout jacket and pants, Sodini walked casually
in into the 30-foot-by-40-foot room.
</P>
<P>
He put his black gym bag on the floor and then fumbled around
for his weapons, the police said. He then turned off the lights.
</P>
<P>
"He did not say anything," Moffatt said of Sodini, who was a
member of the fitness center. "He walked right to the room as if
he knew where he was going and started shooting."
</P>
<P>
The dead were identified as Heidi Overmier, 46, of Carnegie,
Pa., director of group sales at Kennywood Amusement Park; Elizabeth
Gannon, 49, of Pittsburgh, who worked in the radiation department
at Allegheny General Hospital; and Jody Billingsley, 37, of Mount
Lebanon, Pa., a sales representative for a medical equipment
company.
</P>
<P>
Trish Cowen, who lived across the street from Sodini for 13
years, said he had been friendly but had largely kept to himself.
"I never saw any women over there, and he wasn't bad looking,"
Cowen said. "I don't understand it. I just assumed he was gay."
</P>
<P>
In the Web diary, Sodini described his final preparations for
the attack.
</P>
<P>
"I took off today, Monday, and tomorrow to practice my routine
and make sure it is well polished," he wrote. "I need to work out
every detail, there is only one shot. Also I need to be completely
immersed into something before I can be successful. I haven't had a
drink since Friday at about 2:30. Total effort needed. Tomorrow is
the big day."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Any of the 'Practice Papers' left on my coffee table
I used or the notes in my gym bag can be published freely. I will
not be embarrassed, because, well, I will be dead."
</P>
<P>
Sodini owned his own home, which he bought for $78,000 in 1996.
He said in the diary that he had assets of $250,000 and that he had
recently been promoted.
</P>
<P>
In a July entry in his diary, Sodini took notice of a
"beautiful college-aged girl" leaving Cowen's home, apparently
Cowen's 22-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
"Right now my heart is just numb," Cowen said. "What would
have happened if he had a gun and my daughter had been out there?
</P>
<P>
"I'm just grateful he didn't take it out on us when my daughter
was here," she said. "It is so tragic. You never would have
thought, 'Our neighbor,' you know?"

CUBA-U.S.-DETAIN-NYT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CONTRACTOR JAILED IN CUBA WAS AIDING RELIGIOUS GROUPS, U.S. SAYS Ginger Thompson reported from Washington, and Marc Lacey from Mexico City.      WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American contractor detained in Cuba last month
and accused of being a spy is a 60-year-old social worker from the
Washington suburbs who had gone to Cuba to provide communications
equipment to Jewish nonprofit organizations, according to U.S.
officials.
</P>
<P>
In postings on the Internet, the contractor, Alan P. Gross --
whose identify had not previously been made public -- said he had
more than 20 years experience in development work around the world.
One of his Internet networking sites said he had been a volunteer
field organizer for Barack Obama's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say that Gross had gone to Cuba as part of a U.S.
government program and was providing encouragement and financial
assistance to religious nonprofit groups. The officials acknowledge
that Gross entered Cuba without the proper visa, though they
contend that he was not involved in any activities that posed a
violent threat to the Cuban government. And they flatly refute any
allegations that he is a spy.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government, however, has characterized his work as a
threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, where Cuba continues to fire political
passions, Gross' detention has become the source of new tensions
between Washington and Havana, and it threatens to ignite more
debate on Capitol Hill about how the Obama administration ought to
proceed in its Cuba policy.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the case has raised questions about whether the
administration should continue a Bush administration practice of
sending development workers to conduct semi-covert operations.
</P>
<P>
At the time Gross was detained, he had visited Cuba several
times, delivering computer and satellite equipment to three Jewish
community groups, according to people with knowledge of his work.
</P>
<P>
In December, they said, he was on a follow-up trip for
Development Alternatives Inc., a contractor working with the U.S.
Agency for International Development. The people who know about his
work, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not
authorized to comment on the matter, said Gross was sent to
research how the groups were making use of the equipment he had
previously distributed to them.
</P>
<P>
"His work in Cuba was focused on facilitating communications
among people in a nonviolent, nondissident religious
organization," DAI said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Details about Gross and his work in Cuba slowly began to emerge
this week. Gross studied social work at the University of Maryland
and the Virginia Commonwealth University, and he had a long career
as an international development worker that took him to at least 50
countries.
</P>
<P>
Friends described Gross as more a philanthropist than a
businessman. In 2001, he started a company called Joint Business
Development Center, whose Web site says it has "supported Internet
connectivity in locations where there was little or no access,"
including more than 60 satellite terminals in Iraq, Afghanistan,
Armenia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Records show his company earned less than $70,000 last year. One
friend, Howard Feinberg, who has known Gross from their work with
Jewish charitable organizations over 30 years, said, "The Alan I
know is someone who is concerned only about helping improve the
human condition, not meddling in people's politics."
</P>
<P>
Obama came to office promising a new era of engagement with
Cuba. But he has been reluctant to move forward, citing continuing
reports of human rights abuses in Cuba. Some Cuba experts have said
that Gross' arrest may harden Obama's stance.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, meanwhile, said the episode signaled that Obama was just
as committed to overthrowing the government as his predecessor was.
President Raul Castro railed about Gross' work in a speech last
month.
</P>
<P>
Havana has used Gross' arrest as an opportunity to raise an old
grievance: America's long prison terms for five Cuban agents
convicted of spying on Cuban exile organizations. Havana maintains
that the agents were in the United States to prevent terrorist acts
against Cuba and has called on the Obama administration to release
them.
</P>
<P>
As for Gross, Cuba has said very little. The government has not
formally charged him with a crime. Cuban authorities have provided
the United States almost no information on his case, nor have they
made any demands. It took three urgent diplomatic notes from the
United States before Cuban authorities would allow U.S. consular
officials to visit Gross.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Washington and many American experts on Cuba have
been left speculating about Havana's intentions.
</P>
<P>
"The Cuban regime is obviously looking for some kind of U.S.
concession, callously using the contractor as a bargaining chip,"
said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., a ranking member of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials said they suspected that Cuba aimed to shine
light on AID's undercover Cuba programs, whose financing has grown
in the past decade from some $5 million to over $45 million a year
and have a history of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
"We have spent a tremendous amount of money on these programs,
and what do we have to show for it?" asked Rep. Bill Delahunt,
D-Mass. "Are there other ways, or other methods to provide
information to nongovernmental groups? If we want to have influence
on the island, what makes sense?"

HELOISE MAKEOVER: NOT YOU MOTHER ' S ' HINTS '
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN ANTONIO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than 20 years of wearing the same long
hairstyle, silver-tressed Ponce Kiah Marchelle Heloise Cruse Evans,
known simply as Heloise, has a new 'do for the New Year.
</P>
<P>
Just don't ask the San Antonio-based "Hints From Heloise"
columnist to color her gorgeous signature locks, which she's only
done once . . . but more on that later.
</P>
<P>
"I love it!" Heloise exclaims, shaking out her new look,
courtesy Jane Mulrenan, her personal hair stylist. "I've been
looking forward to this. It's just what I wanted."
</P>
<P>
What Heloise, the national high priestess of household hints,
wanted was a blunt-cut coif -- and sexy bangs. So eager was she to
get on with it that she fearlessly executed the first snip with her
mother's own oversized shears. In Mulrenan's hands, Heloise lost
eight inches in length all around.
</P>
<P>
And here's a hint: The bangs were trimmed vertically for a
fuller, yet airy, modern look.
</P>
<P>
Heloise's makeover -- hold onto your vinegar and baking soda,
including smoky eyes -- also is a wonderful example of using the New
Year as motivation for trying something new and fresh, perfect for
the first 2010 issue of Trends with a "New You" focus for the new
decade.
</P>
<P>
During a chat late last year, Heloise, the legendary syndicated
columnist featured internationally in hundreds of newspapers,
mentioned her hairstyle had been virtually unchanged for more than
two decades.
</P>
<P>
We offered to help her with an updated look. It was a special
occasion that called for Mulrenan and Heloise's on-call makeup
expert John McBurney, and a rack of clothes we pulled from local
stores -- looks she loved but said she never would have picked for
herself because the outfits were different from what she's
accustomed to wearing.
</P>
<P>
But isn't that part of the fun of getting a makeover? Getting
others who love fashion to suggest new ways to play up your own
sense of style -- and maybe step out of your comfort zone? After the
photo shoot, Heloise bought three of the four outfits.
</P>
<P>
Clothing, like one's hair style, is one's personal preference,
after all.
</P>
<P>
But often, all one needs is a little nudge to realize other
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, my hair style has always been a part of my comfort
zone,"
</P>
<P>
Heloise says, explaining why she hadn't changed her look all
these years. "A lot of women are afraid to make drastic hair
changes. Later you hear the horror stories about how they can't
maintain it."
</P>
<P>
Heloise recalls the one and only time she applied a temporary
rinse -- red, like Lucille Ball's. She played the joke on her
husband, David, who had been away on a trip (the two wondered how
she'd look).
</P>
<P>
When he arrived at home at 3 a.m., David was afraid he was in
the wrong house. "He nearly died!" Heloise recalls. "Every time
I turned a corner David would say, 'It just doesn't look like
you."'
</P>
<P>
She concurred, but it took two days to wash out the rinse,
except for "those orangey stripes on either side" that took
longer.
</P>
<P>
Now and again she will answer a hair or beauty question.
</P>
<P>
But what we really want to know is what question is asked most
often.
</P>
<P>
"That one," she deadpans, adding that coming in second are
inquires about stinks ("How can I get rid of that garbage disposal
smell?") and third, stains ("What do I do for ring around the
collar?")
</P>
<P>
For the smelly garbage disposal: "Fill the sink with
warm-to-hot water and a squirt of dish soap. Then pull out the
stopper and turn on the disposal. The water pressure causes a big
whoosh. This is a good preventative once a month and will also help
prevent a drain build-up that could lead to a big clog."
</P>
<P>
For the dingy ring around the collar: "Keep the biggest and
cheapest bottle of shampoo in the laundry room and pour it on the
line of dirt. Rub it in, let it set for a minute and toss it into
the laundry. Shampoo is a cleaning agent that breaks down dirt and
body oil in your hair and will do the same for that ring."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of shampoo gets us back to talking about hair and a
hair myth Heloise says we can bust.
</P>
<P>
"Cutting your hair at the ends does nothing to make it grow
faster," she says. "Your hair is dead once you cut it. It is
dead."
</P>
<P>
And don't get her going on another beauty tip: mascara. She
doesn't mind sleeping in hers -- and has been for more than 40
years.
</P>
<P>
"I know women behind the cosmetic counter say you have to take
it off every night. No you don't. It's waterproof. I do not wake up
looking like a raccoon and I don't sleep in contacts. I reapply in
the morning. I know I'll get mail on that one."
</P>
<P>
She receives as many as 3,000 e-mails, letters and faxes weekly
at Heloise central -- a ranch-style home and office on the city's
North Side built by her husband, a contractor.
</P>
<P>
In her leisure time, Heloise dotes on her antique rose bushes
she has tended for 15 years. They stretch more than 100 feet along
a fence. She enjoys flicks from the golden era of the silver screen
and often juggles two and three books simultaneously -- biographies,
history, the military and old Hollywood are favorite subjects. Not
long ago Marlene Dietrich, Gloria Swanson and Greta Garbo were on
her nightstand. Then came Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots.
</P>
<P>
She's also a bit of a daredevil, having ridden in a tank at Camp
Lejeune, flown in a T-38 at Randolph Air Force Base, pulled 7.8 Gs
with the Navy's Blue Angels and at 13,000 feet took a leap of faith
over San Antonio with the Army's Golden Knights parachute team.
</P>
<P>
"I am a military brat. I'm part of the family," Heloise says
proudly. Her father, Marshal Cruse, who went by Mike, "got his
wings here at Kelly Air Force Base. And my brother, Louis D. Cruse,
was in the Air Force at Lackland (Air Force Base)." Her dad, a
lieutenant colonel, also was a pilot during the Cold War era. He
died in 2006.
</P>
<P>
"I do what I can to help our service members and their families
because I've been there. I can help by visiting and giving hints or
by listening to get hints from them to share with others or answer
questions."
</P>
<P>
Why has the column endured?
</P>
<P>
"Because I've been offering years of expertise and knowledge on
what works and doesn't," she says, adding that she stays
technologically current with a Web site, podcasts and often
e-mailing photos and video she shoots on her cell phone. This month
she plans to kick off The Heloise Blog for the Express-News on
mySA.com as well as on the Houston Chronicle's Web site. The blog
also will go national, she said.
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the most meaningful explanation for the column's
longevity comes from the heart.
</P>
<P>
"Mother truly wrote from hers and so do I," Heloise says about
keeping it real and helping readers with "mundane, monotonous and
repetitious things in life we all have to do."

ANDREW LANGE, SCHOLAR OF THE COSMOS, DIES AT 52
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew Lange, an astrophysicist whose balloon-borne measurements
of light left over from the Big Bang played a key role in
elucidating the shape and nature of the universe, was found dead on
Jan. 22 in Los Angeles. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
His death was announced by Jean-Lou Chameau, the president of
the California Institute of Technology, where Lange had until
recently been chairman of the division of physics, mathematics and
astronomy. Chameau said Lange appeared to have taken his own life.
</P>
<P>
Lange devoted his career to a haze of faint microwaves that
pervade the sky, providing a whispery ghost image of the universe
when it was only 400,000 years old, before there were stars,
galaxies or even atoms.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1990s, this work put him in the middle of one of the
grandest quests in science, the effort to discern the fate of the
universe -- whether it would keep expanding forever or collapse one
day into the fire from which it had emerged 14 billion years ago.
According to Einstein, that fate was determined by the large-scale
geometry of space time, which in turn is determined by the amount
of matter and energy in the universe.
</P>
<P>
Theorists had long favored the Euclidean, or "flat," geometry
that students learn in school -- a triangle between three distant
quasars would have internal angles that add up to 180 degrees -- but
astronomers could not find enough matter in the universe to make it
flat. Lange and his collaborators found that it was energy that was
making it flat.
</P>
<P>
Lange was co-leader, with Paolo de Bernardis of the University
of Rome, of an experiment called Boomerang, short for Balloon
Observations of Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics.
During a 10-day flight at 120,000 feet over Antarctica in 1998, the
gadget was able to detect and map faint ripples in the microwave
glow, which could be used like the ticks on a ruler to gauge the
cosmos and read off its geometry and other parameters.
</P>
<P>
The universe, they reported in 1999, is indeed flat. These
results not only suggested that it would expand forever; they also
provided crucial support for a bold theory that the universe had
undergone an explosive expansion, called inflation, when it was
only a fraction of a fraction of a second old.
</P>
<P>
Michael S. Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago,
said of Lange, "He and his Boomerang team got one of the biggest
prizes in cosmology: They were the first to show that the geometry
of the universe is flat."
</P>
<P>
Two similar experiments reported similar results at the same
time. Lange was part of one of them, the Maxima experiment, which
was led by his former professor Paul Richards of the University of
California, Berkeley. His former student Mark Devlin of the
University of Pennsylvania was co-leader of the other, known as the
Microwave Anisotropy Telescope. But astronomers believed that
Boomerang produced the most convincing data.
</P>
<P>
Marc Kamionkowski, a Caltech cosmologist, said, "Boomerang was
just crystal clear; it was the shot heard around the world."
</P>
<P>
The results were subsequently confirmed by the NASA's Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe, a satellite that has been mapping the
entire microwave sky since 2001.
</P>
<P>
These results also dovetailed with the strange discovery in 1998
that the expansion of the universe was speeding up, a discovery
that many astronomers and physicists had viewed with suspicion.
Most of the universe turned out to be not stars and galaxies or
even the mysterious as-yet-unidentified dark matter surrounding
them, but the so-called dark energy driving the acceleration of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
"So there are two very different lines of evidence indicating
that the universe is accelerating," Lange said in an interview
with the European Space Agency in 2001. "I believe it now."
</P>
<P>
Andrew E. Lange was born in Urbana, Ill., on July 23, 1957, the
oldest son of Joan Lange, a school librarian, and Albert Lange, an
architect, and grew up in Easton, Conn. He attended Princeton
University and then the University of California, Berkeley, where
he received a Ph.D. in 1987 and was promptly hired as a professor.
</P>
<P>
While he was at Berkeley as a Packard fellow, Lange met another
Packard fellow, Frances Arnold, a chemical engineer, who had
attended Princeton and Berkeley when he did, but whom he had never
met before then. The pair held a wedding ceremony for family and
friends in 1994, but never made it official with the state of
California, Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
That same year Lange joined Caltech. By then the discovery of
the cosmic microwave background was transforming cosmology.
</P>
<P>
Lange, working with James Bock, now at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, built new detectors, known as spider web bolometers,
designed for studying the cosmic microwave work. The detectors were
used on both Maxima and Boomerang and a series of subsequent cosmic
experiments, including Planck, a satellite launched last year by
the European Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
Lange was part of the Planck team but, always eager to be in the
forefront, was already working on ideas for new experiments.
</P>
<P>
"What will we discover with them?" Lange asked rhetorically in
his 2001 interview. "We don't know. The great thing here is that
you cannot predict what's going to come next. Five years ago no one
took the idea of the dark energy seriously!"
</P>
<P>
His friends and colleagues described Lange as a warm man who
always had a sparkle in his eye. "He was one of those guys who had
an aura of utter confidence and competency," Devlin said. But he
also struggled with depression.
</P>
<P>
"He cared immensely about other people and not enough about
himself," said Arnold, who is now a professor of chemical
engineering at Caltech. At the time of Lange's death, they were
separated.
</P>
<P>
Arnold survives him, along with three children: James Bailey,
her son from a previous relationship, whom Lange raised as his own;
William A. Lange; and Joseph I. Lange. He is also survived by his
parents and a sister, Karen Lange, of Washington, and a brother,
Adam Lange, of St. Louis.

AMERICANS IN HAITI CHARGED WITH CHILDREN ' S ABDUCTION GINGER THOMPSON CONTRIBUTED REPORTING.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten Americans who tried to take 33
Haitian children out the country last week without the government's
consent have been charged with child abduction and criminal
conspiracy, as Haitian officials sought to reassert judicial
control after the Jan. 12 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The Americans, most of them members of a Baptist congregation
from Idaho, had said they intended to rescue Haitian children left
parentless in the quake and take them to what they described as an
orphanage across the border in the Dominican Republic. But they
acknowledged failing to seek approval to remove the children from
Haiti, and several of the children have at least one living parent.
</P>
<P>
The Americans will face a potentially extended legal proceeding
in Haiti and could, if convicted, face prison terms of up to 15
years.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Mazar Fortil, decided not to pursue what could
have been the most serious charge against the group, that of
trafficking. The charges will now be considered by an investigative
judge, who under Haitian law has up to three months to decide
whether to pursue the matter further.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the group, Laura Silsby, a businesswoman who
describes herself as a missionary as well, has also come under
scrutiny at home in Idaho, where employees complain of unpaid wages
and the state has placed liens on her company bank account.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer for the group, Edwin Coq, said after a hearing on
Thursday that nine of his 10 clients were "completely innocent,"
but that, in an apparent reference to Silsby, "If the judiciary
were to keep one, it could be the leader of the group."
</P>
<P>
The Haitian capital lost courthouses, judges, lawyers and its
main prison in the earthquake, straining the judiciary along with
everything else. Prosecutors said this was the first criminal case
to receive a hearing in Port-au-Prince since the natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
The hearing took place in a hilltop courthouse that had minor
cracks in the walls and scores of squatters living outside. A crush
of journalists sought access to the defendants on their way into
the courthouse, where police officers in riot gear prevented
access.
</P>
<P>
The Americans were transported in two Haitian police vehicles --
one labeled "Child Protection Brigade" -- from the police station
where they have been held since the weekend to Port-au-Prince's
main criminal courthouse. Coq said beforehand that their immediate
release was possible, and the police who transported the detainees
took their luggage to the hearing as well in case they were to be
freed.
</P>
<P>
Silsby, who had helped organize the group's mission, sounded a
hopeful note as she waited to be taken into court, saying, "We're
just trusting God for a positive outcome."
</P>
<P>
But during the hearing, Jean Ferge Joseph, a deputy prosecutor,
told the Americans that their case was not being dropped and that
it would be sent to a judge for further review. "That judge can
free you, but he can also continue to hold you for further
proceedings," the deputy prosecutor said, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
When they received the news, the Americans did not appear
distraught, Coq, their lawyer, said. "They prayed," he said.
"They looked down and prayed."
</P>
<P>
Reuters, which had a reporter in the session, reported that all
10 of the detainees acknowledged to the prosecutor that they had
apparently violated the law when they tried to take the children
from Haiti, although they said they were unaware of that until
after they were detained.
</P>
<P>
"We did not have any intention to violate the law but now we
understand it's a crime," said Paul Robert Thompson, a pastor who
led the group in prayer during a break in the session.
</P>
<P>
Silsby asked the prosecutor not only to release the group, whose
members range in age from 18 to 55, but to allow them to continue
their work in Haiti. "We simply wanted to help the children," she
said. "We petition the court not only for our freedom but also for
our ability to continue to help."
</P>
<P>
As they were led out of the courthouse one by one for their
return to jail, some of the Americans smiled as reporters
surrounded them. They left without comment.
</P>
<P>
The Americans were arrested on Friday as they tried to take the
33 children by bus to the Dominican Republic, where they said they
were in the process of leasing or building an orphanage. It is
unclear if the group had arranged for accommodations to house the
children in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
A Web site for the group, the New Life Children's Refuge, said
that the Haitian children there would stay in a "loving Christian
home-like environment" and be eligible for adoption through
agencies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Americans and members of their churches have said they are
innocent of any wrongdoing, and described the case as a
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
In an interview earlier this week, Silsby said the group had
come to Haiti to rescue children orphaned by the earthquake, and
that "our hearts were in the right place."
</P>
<P>
But some of the children had living parents, and some of those
parents said that the Baptists had promised simply to educate the
youngsters in the Dominican Republic and to allow them to return to
Haiti to visit.
</P>
<P>
Silsby had made her intentions known to child protection
officials, human rights experts and Dominican authorities in Haiti,
all of whom warned her that she could be charged with trafficking
if she tried to take children out of the country without proper
documentation.
</P>
<P>
Some Haitian leaders have called the Americans kidnappers, but
their case also has created divisions. Outside the courthouse on
Thursday, one onlookers backed the Americans. "The process they
followed was wrong, but they were not stealing kids," said
Beatrice St. Julien, a mother of one son. "They came here to help
us."
</P>
<P>
Until Thursday, Haitian judicial officials had left open the
possibility that the group could be returned to the United States
for trial, sparing Haiti's crippled justice system a high-profile
criminal prosecution fraught with diplomatic and political land
mines.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have been in communication with their Haitian
counterparts to discuss the case, but the State Department has also
said that the decision on whether to pursue charges committed on
Haitian soil remains a Haitian matter.
</P>
<P>
One expert said that by pursuing the case Haitian authorities
seemed to be trying to make a point. "Haiti's decision to
prosecute the Baptist missionaries may be motivated, in part, by
the need to show its own people and the world that it is a viable
entity that is tackling the grave problem of international child
abductions in Haiti," Christopher J. Schmidt, a lawyer with Bryan
Cave LLP in St. Louis who has been involved in multiple cases of
international kidnapping, said in a statement.

AMERICAN CHARGED IN HAITI HAD TROUBLES IN IDAHO TOBY LYLES CONTRIBUTED RESEARCH.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MERIDIAN, Idaho
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leader of the group of Americans charged
on Thursday with abducting children in Haiti is an Idaho
businesswoman with a complicated financial history that involves
complaints from employees over unpaid wages, state liens on a
company bank account and lawsuits in small claims court.
</P>
<P>
The leader, Laura Silsby, defaulted in July on the mortgage on a
house in an unfinished subdivision here in Meridian, a suburb of
Boise, according to the Ada County Tax Assessor's Office. Yet in
November, Silsby registered a new nonprofit, the New Life
Children's Refuge, at the address of the house, which she bought in
2008 for $358,000.
</P>
<P>
New Life Children's Refuge is the name of the orphanage Silsby
and the nine other Americans charged in Haiti said they had planned
to establish in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
Silsby lost the house in Meridian to foreclosure on Dec. 7,
records show, and it stands empty, with signs in the yard promoting
a foreclosure sale.
</P>
<P>
"I get mail for her all the time," said LaChelle Bohner, who
lives two doors down from the house. Bohner said the mail included
collection notices.
</P>
<P>
Silsby and her business, Personal Shopper, which provides
shopping services for Internet customers, have faced multiple legal
claims.
</P>
<P>
According to state records and officials, Personal Shopper has
been named 14 times in complaints from employees over unpaid wages.
Among the reasons cited by the employees for having not been paid
were "no money for payroll" and "fully investor funded and
investors have been hit hard by the economy."
</P>
<P>
Employees won nine of the cases, forcing Personal Shopper to pay
nearly $31,000 in wages and $4,000 in fines. The Idaho Department
of Labor initially put liens on a company bank account to get the
money.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't like that so they said: 'How much do we owe? We'll
pay it,"' said Bob Fick, a spokesman for the department, adding
that unpaid wage complaints were not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
State officials said Personal Shopper had paid all the wage
claims upheld by the state. But another former employee has sued
Personal Shopper in civil court. A jury trial is set for Feb. 22
over a claim by the employee, Robin Oliver, that Personal Shopper
owes her more than $22,000.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Silsby said Thursday that he could not comment on
the case.
</P>
<P>
One of the people awarded unpaid wages was Chris Holmes, who
said he was not surprised that Silsby had run into trouble in
Haiti. Holmes, who did database work, said Silsby often showed a
"lack of forethought," shifting business models to suit the
investors who kept the company afloat.
</P>
<P>
"She would come up with an idea on Wednesday, and on Friday
there would be a new idea that was 180 degrees different," Holmes
said.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, Silsby received a Femtor Award for "Businesswoman of
the Year"; the awards are sponsored by the eWomenNetwork, a group
that promotes women and their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Silsby, who has young children in Idaho, was divorced in 2007.
She and her former husband lived in Meridian, but public records
were not clear about where she currently resides.
</P>
<P>
The offices of Personal Shopper, in an office park in Meridian,
have been shuttered this week, with mail dating to at least last
week stacked on the floor.
</P>
<P>
Clint Henry, pastor of Central Valley Baptist Church in
Meridian, where five of the Americans charged in Haiti attend
services, said Silsby had attended his church for about two years.
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't find any finer Christian people than these
people," Henry said in an interview earlier this week.

AFTER KILLING A CHIMP, THE DESCENT OF AN OFFICER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
STAMFORD, Conn.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everybody here knew Travis the Chimp, whose
owners drove him around in a tow truck, and Police Officer Frank
Chiafari, on the job for 25 years, remembered playing with him when
their paths would cross.
</P>
<P>
"When I saw him, he was small and cute and friendly -- he'd wave
at you," Chiafari recalled. "Who would have ever thought when we
were playing together, we'd have this incident 15 years later?"
</P>
<P>
It has been a little over a year since Travis, the 14-year-old,
200-pound pet of Sandra Herold, 71, mauled a family friend in
Herold's driveway. Chiafari and another officer were the first to
respond to Herold's 911 call, and after the chimpanzee attacked his
vehicle and opened the driver-side door in the driveway, Chiafari
fatally shot Travis.
</P>
<P>
The story and its sensational underpinnings -- Travis lived like
a human, eating steak and drinking wine and, when he became hostile
the day of the attack, ingesting Xanax -- swept the globe. Travis
had appeared in Old Navy and Coca-Cola commercials and television
shows; the actress Morgan Fairchild, who had appeared beside him,
called his death a "sin."
</P>
<P>
The victim, Charla Nash, 56, survived. Her recovery from the
attack -- the chimp bit and clawed off her face and hands -- was
presented to the world via an episode of the "Oprah Winfrey Show"
in November. She was blind, her features lost in a bulbous and
livid pulp.
</P>
<P>
But until now, no one had heard Chiafari's story.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in Stamford police headquarters on Tuesday,
Chiafari, 53, a husband and a father of three, described that day
and the crippling depression and anxiety that followed. He was
haunted not just by the frightening encounter with the bloody and
enraged chimp that outweighed him by 50 pounds, but also by images
of the victim in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
"I'd go to the mall and see women and imagine them without
faces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiafari required therapy but was denied a worker's compensation
claim. The reason was harrowing episodes involving a person --
shooting a suspect, for example -- would be covered but similar
encounters with animals were not.
</P>
<P>
His visits to a therapist were eventually covered by the city of
Stamford after police and union officials became involved on his
behalf, said Sgt. Joseph Kennedy, president of the Stamford Police
Association.
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Andrew J. McDonald, a Stamford Democrat, has
introduced legislation that would cover an officer's compensation
for mental or emotional impairment after killing an animal when
under threat of deadly force. Chiafari plans to testify on Thursday
at a General Assembly Committee on Labor and Public Employees
hearing on behalf of the proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
Chiafari did not come to the job naturally. Raised in Queens, he
moved to Connecticut in his late 20s after eight years working in
Manhattan as an apprentice at a printer and as a store detective in
Times Square -- a job he said he hated. A singer-songwriter, he
performed Beatles covers and original songs in clubs in Queens and
Long Island and at parties.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he took the Stamford police test with a friend and
passed; he joined the department in 1985. He still sings and
continues to record covers and original songs. He regularly takes
long walks to relax, and he loves animals. He had only once before
fired his gun in the line of duty, to kill a deer that had been
struck by a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 16, 2009, Chiafari started his shift at 3 p.m.,
reporting his location with his police radio and stopping at a
Starbucks for tea with another officer. Then the radio sounded.
</P>
<P>
"The call came over as 'monkey attacking someone,' " he said.
"At first it sounded humorous. Then they said, 'Code Three' --
lights and sirens, get there fast.
</P>
<P>
"I could tell something was not right."
</P>
<P>
The dispatcher became more urgent as the officers, in separate
cars, sped to Herold's house on Rock Rimmon Road. Chiafari realized
who the so-called monkey was: The Herold family owned a towing
company that occasionally responded to police calls to move
vehicles, and they would bring their pet chimp along. ("Travis
loves cops," Herold said in 1998.)
</P>
<P>
As Chiafari drove, he thought, "Wait a minute, that's Travis."
</P>
<P>
He pulled up to the house and saw a lump of clothing in the
driveway. "Then I realized it's a human being," he said. "It was
all ripped apart."
</P>
<P>
He parked to the right of the body, and the other officer parked
on its left. Chiafari's car blocked the body from the front porch,
where he saw Travis jumping up and down, in a "frenzy."
</P>
<P>
"He starts bashing the passenger window," he said. "I'm
terrified. I see what he's done to the victim." He drew his
pistol, but Herold, who had been hiding in a vehicle, emerged
behind the chimp, entering his line of fire. He looked back at the
victim. "She had no face, and there's blood pulsating out. She's
bleeding out." He holstered his gun.
</P>
<P>
Travis swatted the side-view mirror off the squad car "like it
was butter," Chiafari said. As he puzzled over how he could help
the victim, Travis returned to the porch, then calmly walked around
his car and approached the driver-side door.
</P>
<P>
"I forgot I had the door unlocked," Chiafari said. He had
unlocked it to help Nash before the chimp distracted him. "He
pulls the door open. Now we're, like, face to face with each other.
Our eyes met."
</P>
<P>
There was blood all over the chimp, whose owner had stabbed him
in the back with a butcher knife. The chimp seemed as surprised
that he had opened the door as Chiafari, who was pinned in his seat
by a computer console and again drawing his pistol.
</P>
<P>
"He gave me a split second to react," he said. "He shows his
teeth, a snarl, and I see blood. I see his fangs. I just start to
shoot."
</P>
<P>
He said that he does not remember hearing the four shots and
that the chimp did not seem to react; he thought the gun had
misfired. But then Travis screamed one last time and ambled away.
</P>
<P>
Chiafari and paramedics, who had been waiting in their vehicles
for the chimp to leave, rushed to the body on the ground. "She had
no face," he said. "Her hands are off. There are thumbs and
fingers all over the place." He called out to her. "I feel bad,
but I was hoping she wasn't conscious."
</P>
<P>
But Nash reached out with the stumps of her arms and tried to
grab the officer's leg, a memory that was perhaps the worst for him
that day.
</P>
<P>
Travis had entered his home and died in his living quarters.
Nash was rushed to a hospital. Chiafari was, too, for shock, and
then sent home, where he told his wife and children -- a 10-year-old
girl and a teenage boy and girl -- what had happened.
</P>
<P>
"The next morning, I crashed," he said. "I'd always heard of
post-traumatic stress. Tell you the truth, I don't think I believed
in it."
</P>
<P>
He saw a therapist and told the story with great difficulty,
remembering the chimp's fingers -- "like sausages" -- smashing at
his window and rocking the car. After the attack, he said, he could
not wear a red shirt because it reminded him of blood. Everyone
wanted to hear the story. His therapist told him to politely
decline, which helped.
</P>
<P>
Chiafari returned to work a month or so later. At first he could
not drive down Rock Rimmon Road, until he forced himself to visit
the fateful driveway and confront his fear.
</P>
<P>
People second-guessed him: "Why didn't I wait for a stun gun?
Why didn't I talk to it?" He shook his head. "I can't say, 'Hey
Travis, let's wait for a stun gun.' " He believes shooting the
chimp when he did saved Nash's life by allowing paramedics to reach
her.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, waves of panic and depression came and went. He was
plagued by dreams of a faceless woman on a July family visit to
Disney World that ruined his appetite and his vacation. Nash's
much-publicized "Oprah" visit, which he avoided watching, brought
back painful memories. But he said he was feeling more and more
like his old self.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a positive person," he said, adding that he holds open
the possibility of meeting Nash someday -- but not yet.
</P>
<P>
He has a sense of humor about his reaction to that day. "I'll
go to the store and my daughter will say, 'Daddy, don't look in the
corner,' and it's a chimp in the corner," he said with a laugh. He
still avoids news coverage of the shooting and any shows about
deadly chimps. "On TV, 'When Animals Attack' -- I turn it off."
</P>
<P>
So naturally, when the Animal Planet network asked if Chiafari
would participate in a re-enactment of the attack, he declined.
Someone else played his part, and the episode is scheduled to be
shown on March 28 as part of a series titled "Fatal Attractions."
</P>
<P>
Travis dictated the events of that fatal day, but Chiafari does
not hold him responsible.
</P>
<P>
"I consider him a victim," he said. "He should have been in
the jungle where he's supposed to be. Not in a house drinking wine
and taking Xanax."

KERMIT TYLER, 96, PLAYER OF A FATEFUL, IF MINOR, ROLE IN PEARL HARBOR ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They were only four words, but they made him a footnote figure
in a catastrophic day for America and shadowed him the rest of his
long life: "Don't worry about it."
</P>
<P>
It was a few minutes after 7 o'clock in the morning, Dec. 7,
1941. Lt. Kermit Tyler, an Army fighter pilot, was manning the
aircraft tracking center at Fort Shafter in Hawaii, near the vast
Pearl Harbor naval base, when he received a phone call from a
nearby radar station. Two Army privates watching the screen
reported picking up a large group of approaching planes.
</P>
<P>
It was only Tyler's second day at the tracking center; he had no
understanding of radar, had been given no specific orders on what
he was supposed to do and was accompanied by a lone Army private
serving as a telephone operator. A group of servicemen assigned to
plot the locations of unidentified planes had finished their
night's work and gone back to their barracks.
</P>
<P>
Tyler would recall how a friend once told him that a Honolulu
radio station normally off the air at night would be broadcasting
around the clock if American bombers were flying in from the
mainland, enabling them to beam in on the signal. He had heard
music on his car radio when he drove to his post hours earlier from
his beach house on Oahu's north shore. And he was aware that B-17
Flying Fortress bombers were scheduled to arrive that day.
</P>
<P>
"I knew the equipment was pretty new," Tyler said of the radar
scope in an interview with The San Diego Union-Tribune long
afterward. "In fact, the guy who was on the scope, who first
detected the planes, it was the first time he'd ever sat at the
scope. So I figured they were pretty green and had not had any
opportunity to view a flight of B-17s coming in. Common sense said,
Well, these are the B-17s. So I told them, 'Don't worry about it.'
"
</P>
<P>
The radar had picked up the first wave of the Japanese bombers
and fighters that began arriving over Pearl Harbor at 7:55 a.m. and
devastated Battleship Row, plunging the United States into World
War II.
</P>
<P>
Tyler was not disciplined for failing to follow up on the report
and went on to command fighter units in the Pacific during the war,
receiving the Legion of Merit. A career Air Force officer, he was
assigned in the mid-1950s to the Air Defense Command at Colorado
Springs. He had the rank of lieutenant colonel when he retired in
1961.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 23, his family announced, he died at his home in San
Diego. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
Tyler had been reluctant to speak about Pearl Harbor Sunday, but
he did grant interviews on occasion.
</P>
<P>
Kermit Arthur Tyler was born on April 21, 1913, in Oelwein,
Iowa. He grew up in Southern California and became an Army flying
cadet in 1936. After leaving military service, he obtained a
business degree and worked as real estate broker.
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his son, Terry, of Temecula, Calif.; his
daughters, Carol Daniels of Morro Bay, Calif., and Julie Jones of
La Mesa, Calif.; three grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.
His wife, Marian, died in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Gordon W. Prange, a historian who spent nearly four decades
researching the Pearl Harbor events, wrote that the Army private
who phoned the radar report to Tyler had "made one big mistake"
by not stating that the screen showed more than 50 approaching
planes.
</P>
<P>
Had he been given that information, "Tyler could scarcely have
mistaken it for a flight of B-17s," Prange concluded in his book
"At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor"
(McGraw-Hill, 1981), written with Donald M. Goldstein and Katherine
V. Dillon. "Such a number would represent a good slice of the
entire American inventory of this type of bomber."
</P>
<P>
Prange wrote that even if Tyler had notified a superior of the
radar report, little could have been done immediately beyond
dispersing planes parked closely together, easy targets for
Japanese bombers.
</P>
<P>
More serious, Prange maintained, was the failure that day by
anyone in the Army to tell the Navy of the radar sighting.
Revelation of the clear track of the approaching planes could have
helped the Navy find the Japanese carriers that had conveyed them
within striking distance, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Martinez, the National Park Service historian at the
Pearl Harbor memorial, persuaded Tyler to attend ceremonies there
marking the 50th and 58th anniversaries of the attack and to speak
of his decision to say "Don't worry about it."
</P>
<P>
"The words have their own infamy that has surrounded this
story," Martinez told The Honolulu Advertiser in 1999. "It's so
unfair."
</P>
<P>
But he added: "History doesn't allow you to escape an event as
large as Pearl Harbor. He was haunted by this."

' TICKET TO THE CIRCUS ' : THE IMPROBABLE RIDE OF THE LAST MRS. MAILER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Barbara Jean Davis -- the future Norris Church Mailer -- met
Norman Mailer at a party in Russellville, Ark., in 1975, she was a
high school art teacher and divorced single mother. She'd never
flown in an airplane.She had a closet full of polyester clothes.
When she took Mailer back to her house that first evening, she
poured him a glass of Boone's Farm apple wine. Norman Mailer was,
well, Norman Mailer: novelist, public intellectual, brawling social
provocateur. His best work ("The Naked and the Dead," "Armies of
the Night") might have been largely behind him, but he was
America's best-known and most notorious writer, as famous for his
deeds off the page as on. He'd run for mayor of New York City;been
married five times; had stabbed his second wife, Adele, in a
drunken fit after a party; and was the impish scourge of feminists.
His reputation, like his round belly, preceded him.
</P>
<P>
In her entertaining new memoir, "A Ticket to the Circus,"
Norris Mailer writes that she found that belly, as well as his
"cute little" behind, sort of sexy. Norman Mailer, at 52, may
have been twice her age but was "easily the most interesting man I
had ever met." He radiated energy, she writes, "like a little
steam heater." (Mailer knew from steam heaters. She'd already had
a small relationship with Bill Clinton, before he'd married
Hillary.)
</P>
<P>
Before long, Barbara and Norman were a couple. He sent her love
letters in the Barry White mold. ("And you, stand-up lady, are
golden as the sun.") She cut his wooly hair and saved the
clippings in a white satin heart-shaped pillow. He soon
disentangled from his fifth wife and various other lovers. She
moved to New York and, for her intermittent modeling career, took
the name Norris Church. She became Mailer's sixth wife in 1980, and
gave birth to his son John Buffalo. She was with him until he died,
in November of 2007.
</P>
<P>
"A Ticket to the Circus" is not a tell-all memoir; it's a
tell-enough memoir. It's Mailer's own plucky and sometimes
sentimental autobiography, written in the lemony sweet-tea mode of
Southern novelists like Lee Smith. It details her Arkansas
upbringing in a poor family: Her father built roads; the family had
an outhouse. At 3, Mailer won the Little Miss Little Rock contest.
She was married by 20, to a man who left to serve in Vietnam, and
soon began to hear a voice in her head "telling me I had missed
the parade."
</P>
<P>
Mailer doesn't hide the darker elements in her story: Her
mother's shock therapy treatments, her own rape by a friend's older
brother. She also includes embarrassing bits other memoirists might
have omitted, including goopy letters and poems she sent Mailer.
</P>
<P>
You were there and
      I was there
      in a pocket
      of sunshine
      in a vacuum of space.
</P>
<P>
This book perks up when Norman Mailer strides fully onto the
stage. He became the "Henry Higgins to my Eliza Doolittle," the
author writes, and soon Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell and Woody Allen
and Jackie Onassis were coming to their parties; they flew to
Manila for an Ali-Frazier fight and hung with Imelda Marcos; they
palled around with the Ramones and Farrah Fawcett and Fidel Castro.
She ran Mailer's life like a ship, and organized the family events
and vacations that held his big family together. Yet, she writes,
"Sex was the cord that bound us together."
</P>
<P>
"A Ticket to the Circus" spills over with piquant details
about Norman Mailer. He was a terrible driver. He liked to arrive
hours early for airplane flights. He had few literary friends. He
professed to love jazz, but it was only the atmosphere he liked --
he detested the music. He was fanatical about coleslaw. His best
move, in a fight, was a head butt. Later in life, his cocktail of
choice was red wine mixed with a bit of orange juice, what Norris
Mailer calls "a mild sangria punch." He cheerfully woke his kids
up, during vacations, with vulgar chants he'd learned in the Army.
</P>
<P>
Norris Mailer does not dig deeply into Mailer's writing, nor
into his reputation as a crackling antagonist to feminists. The
macho bluster in his book "The Prisoner of Sex" (1971), she
suggests, was misunderstood:
</P>
<P>
"To me, the humor and irony was inherent, but you can't
transfer the twinkle in the eye to the page, so a lot of people
treated everything he said as perfectly serious, like his famous
comment that women should be kept in cages. Who would think he was
serious about that?"
</P>
<P>
"A Ticket to the Circus" is a love story, and you won't read
this memoir without feeling pangs of jealousy: These two lived
large, sun-drenched lives in almost every regard. That life also
meant, for Norris Mailer, a good deal of heartbreak. He continued
to take lovers, and he sometimes gave her laughable excuses for
them. While he was working on his CIA novel, "Harlot's Ghost"
(1991), she writes, "He said he needed to live that kind of double
life, to know what his characters were going through."
</P>
<P>
She took an emotional step away from him because of the affairs,
she writes, and although she loved him, she never took that step
back. At one point, she asks: "Why had I been so consumed by this
old, fat, bombastic, lying little dynamo?"
</P>
<P>
Norman Mailer's end was not pretty. Before undergoing bypass
surgery late in his life, his doctors made him get all his teeth
pulled, to prevent infection.
</P>
<P>
"That was the beginning of his decline," Norris Mailer writes.
His dental implants didn't take, and he was forced to wear false
teeth that never quite fit. He began to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
Mailer had her own health problems, including a long battle with
cancer. It's one she's still fighting. You believe her when she
writes, near the end of this gracious memoir, "If I go tomorrow, I
will still be ahead."

FOR DUTCH DEFENDER, PAY AND A PLATFORM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sky Blue FC's new Dutch defender, Daphne Koster, is the epitome
of a free agent.
</P>
<P>
She played for the AZ Alkmaar club in the Netherlands, where
women's soccer draws only a smattering of fans, and no paycheck.
Most of the top clubs, like Ajax, Feyenoord and PSV Eindhoven, do
not yet have women's teams.
</P>
<P>
Koster earned a modest salary from the country's soccer
association, employed as a "social worker" to the players on the
country's youth international teams. She only cost Sky Blue, the
defending champion in Women's Professional Soccer, the price of a
plane ticket.
</P>
<P>
"Women's football, I mean soccer, is always in the shadows
because in the Netherlands, the biggest sport is for the men,"
Koster said before Sunday's season-opening 1-0 win over Chicagoat
Yurcak Field on the campus of Rutgers in Piscataway, N.J. For the
record, the biggest women's sport in her native land is field
hockey.
</P>
<P>
"Coming here for me was a dream. I always thought it was a big
sport here. At home, the sport is not professional, the players are
either students or working. Me, I'm very happy with this
situation."
</P>
<P>
In the Netherlands, Koster's autograph is coveted by screeching
girls. But in New Jersey, it was more like the first day of school
wearing the orange home uniforms of Sky Blue which are the same
color as those of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"I felt pressure early in the game," Koster said after
Sunday's victory. "It was a difficult first game. There was more
communication in the second half, and I think we will work better.
But it was a good start."
</P>
<P>
The team's defense appeared shaky at times, making errant passes
and allowing a league-record 14 corner kicks by Chicago. The
first-year coach Pauliina Miettinen of Finland was not overly
pleased.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't pretty; I think we brought our B game," she said.
"Daphne is tough, can read the game, but she's in the toughest
league in the world and needs to make adjustments and communicate
better. That goes for all of us."
</P>
<P>
Koster vaulted into the sporting consciousness in the
Netherlands after leading the surprising Dutch women's team to the
semifinals of last year's European championshipin Finland, where it
lost to England in overtime. The team played a style that has been
called Tulip Catenaccio, a generally defensive, counterattacking
system, with Koster, the captain, anchoring the defense. She has
played 91 times for the national team and will miss some league
matches with Sky Blue as the Dutch attempt to qualify for the 2011
Women's World Cup in Germany. It is an acknowledged long shot, with
the Dutch in a qualifying group with powerful Norway. They next
play on April 22 at Macedonia. Only the first-place team will
advance to the next round.
</P>
<P>
Along with athletes like Ruud Gullit, Paul van Himst and Justine
Henin, she is a member of the committee that is seeking the 2018 or
the 2022 World Cup in a joint bid by the Netherlands and Belgium.
This week, she is being followed by a Dutch public television
network, which is working on a profile of her. The people from the
network have begun to call her Mrs. Einstein, playing off her
clutch of spiky blonde hair and the fact that she is living with a
family in Princeton, N.J., where the scientist Albert Einstein took
up residence after fleeing Germany in the 1930s. On Monday, Koster
was in Manhattan with her parents and boyfriend, the two-man TV
crew in tow.
</P>
<P>
"What is great here is that I'm not working and I can focus on
the game; it's so much better for me," Koster said. "I can
concentrate 100 percent. And it's such a challenge because this
competition is the best in the world. I play against the greatest
strikers here, players with technical ability who are big and
strong. Players like Marta, Kelly Smith, Tasha Kai and all the
American national team players. It is for me the best in the
world."
</P>
<P>
Koster, 29, is among Sky Blue's three new international players.
Joining Koster are the Swedish forward Jessica Landstrom, 25, and
the Finnish forward/midfielder Laura Kalmari, 30, who played in
college at Portland. WPS teams can sign up to five international
players.
</P>
<P>
This year, the league has players from 19 countries, up from 12
in its inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being followed by Dutch TV, Koster also writes a
weekly blogfor the newspaper De Telegraaf of Amsterdam. She is
among about 60 WPS players on Twitter some of whom tweet from the
sideline during games. On the field, Koster said her role was
"play clean and hold the ball, and to destroy."
</P>
<P>
NOTES
</P>
<P>
The new 12-team USSF Division-2 Pro League began play last
weekend. The league's 180 games will be streamed live, and free,
online from each team's Web site.
</P>
<P>
Major League Soccer has increased the size of the rosters for
its 16 teams to 26 players from 24 to accommodate two more of what
it calls homegrown players from youth academies. Teams are now
allowed to sign four players from their development academies
without exposing them to the league's annual draft.

CHILD WHO SURVIVED LIBYAN AIR CRASH IS STABLE NICOLA CLARK REPORTED FROM PARIS, AND MARK MCDONALD FROM HONG KONG.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Dutch boy who was the only survivor of a plane crash
in Libya that killed 103 people was in stable condition Thursday
after undergoing surgery on his broken legs, according to Libyan
hospital officials quoted by news agencies.
</P>
<P>
Ruben van Assouw, 9, from the city of Tilburg, was returning
from a South African safari with his 11-year-old brother and their
parents, his grandmother told a Dutch newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The grandmother, An van de Sande, spoke to Brabants Dagblad, and
a photograph on the paper's website showed the boy in a hospital
bed in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. She said Ruben would be taken
back to the Netherlands as soon as he was able to travel.
</P>
<P>
The airliner crashed Wednesday morning on approach to the
airport in Tripoli. Libyan and Dutch officials said 92 passengers
were killed -- most of them Dutch tourists -- along with 11 crew
members.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hameeda al-Saheli, the head of the pediatric unit at the
hospital, told the state news agency in Libya that Ruben had four
breaks in his legs, The Associated Press reported, although he had
no neurological injuries or internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
The plane, Afriqiyah Airways Flight 771 from Johannesburg,
crashed at 6 a.m., the airline said.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash of the Airbus jet, which occurred in good
weather, was under investigation, though Libya's transportation
minister said Libyan authorities had ruled out terrorism. That
determination was made quickly, and the minister, Mohammed Zidan,
gave no indication of how officials had reached that conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The flight recorders have been retrieved from the wreckage and
will be analyzed, Zidan said.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Hoeltgen, a spokesman for the European Aviation Safety
Agency in Cologne, Germany, said the aircraft had been inspected at
least three times in recent months by the French civil aviation
authority, which did not find any significant safety problems.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Royal Dutch Touring Club ANWB said 61 of the
dead were with two Dutch tour groups returning from South Africa,
one going to Brussels and the other to Dusseldorf, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Ad Meijer, a spokesman in The Hague for the Dutch foreign
minister, Maxime Verhagen, said the Dutch Embassy staff had not yet
verified whether all of those tourists were Dutch.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Office confirmed that
at least one British citizen was on board.According to news
reports, 22 victims were Libyan and at least 3 were South African.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Investigations and Analyses in France said that it
had sent two investigators to Tripoli and that Airbus, which
manufactured the plane, had sent a team of five specialists to
assist the Libyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Photos from the scene showed debris strewn across a wide area.
Workers wearing surgical masks picked through gnarled rows of
seats, retrieving remains and personal items like passports and
cell phones. With the exception of the plane's tail fin and parts
of the wings, few large pieces of the plane appeared to have
remained intact.
</P>
<P>
Airbus said the plane was delivered in September to Afriqiyah
Airways. The plane had accumulated about 1,600 flight hours in
about 420 flights.
</P>
<P>
Flight 771 originated in Johannesburg and was scheduled to stop
in Tripoli before continuing to Gatwick Airport near London. The
airline's schedule indicated that the plane was an Airbus A330-200
with a capacity of 253 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Afriqiyah Airways said the plane crashed just short of the
runway. The skies were clear with visibility of 3 to 4 miles, and
the winds were very light, according to weather reports. The crash
was the first for Afriqiyah, which was founded in Tripoli in 2001.

TAKING HER DAUGHTER ART: PHOTO AVAILABLE FOR NYT CLIENTS SECOND OF TWO PARTS BY THOMAS C. TOBIN AND JOE CHILDS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago, when Natalie Hagemo was 19, pregnant and
working for the Church of Scientology, she couldn't wait to be a
mother.
</P>
<P>
She was near the end of her first trimester, she says, when
colleagues in Scientology's military-style religious order, the Sea
Organization, began pressuring her to get an abortion.
</P>
<P>
Two high-ranking officers said terminating the pregnancy would
allow her to keep working. They berated her when she said no.
</P>
<P>
Supervisors told her to hide her expanding belly lest co-workers
start thinking it was acceptable to get pregnant. Friends and
colleagues shunned her.
</P>
<P>
Hagemo stood fast and, with her husband at her side, delivered
Shelby on Aug. 20, 1990.
</P>
<P>
Hagemo left the Sea Org but remained an active parishioner and
raised her daughter as a Scientologist.
</P>
<P>
When Shelby was 14, a recruiter came by the local church and
signed her up to serve in the Sea Org for a billion years. Hagemo
put aside her doubts and allowed it, figuring her daughter would
want to come home soon.
</P>
<P>
A week or so later, Shelby called home in tears, wanting out.
Hagemo called a church supervisor to discuss the discharge
procedure. She remembers his anger:
</P>
<P>
You have no say in this. How dare you interfere. You are
suppressive.
</P>
<P>
She reminded him that Shelby was 14; she was still her legal
guardian. He told Hagemo the Sea Org didn't have to follow the law
of the non-Scientology world.
</P>
<P>
Angry and worried, Hagemo flew to Los Angeles to get her
daughter out. She said it took two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Church spokesman Tommy Davis said Hagemo's account is "false
and denied." He said she was "never pressured to have an
abortion," the Sea Org is not hostile to pregnant women and, when
Shelby asked to leave, the church helped her "route out."
</P>
<P>
Not until this year did Hagemo tell her daughter what happened
20 years ago, and how several colleagues submitted to pressures to
get abortions.
</P>
<P>
"I look at you and I think how many more like you there could
have been. And I think about the moms and the dads who had to go
through that. And for what?"
</P>
<P>
The church, she says, wanted it both ways. In the womb, Shelby
was a problem, easily discarded.
</P>
<P>
"Well, the problem became a commodity. She could now work all
these hours in the Sea Org, be a cog in a wheel. She was now worth
something.
</P>
<P>
"In my head I was thinking about the irony of it all. Fourteen
years later, the child I would not abort, the Sea Org is now trying
to keep from me."
</P>
<P>
Marrying young
</P>
<P>
Hagemo was 4 when her parents divorced and her mom married a
Scientologist.
</P>
<P>
She was in her early teens when her mom told her dad he couldn't
see his daughters if he continued taking drugs. He chose the drugs.
</P>
<P>
"It devastated me," Hagemo said. "Who makes a choice like
that?"
</P>
<P>
Growing up on Oahu in the 1970s, she hung out at the Scientology
community church, or "org," in downtown Honolulu. Kids played and
talked while parents took courses and got counseling.
</P>
<P>
Hagemo was 13 when she read The Problems of Work, by Scientology
founder L. Ron Hubbard. The book said if something is confusing
you, pick a "stable datum," a piece of information known to be
true, and build on it. That and other Scientology strategies helped
Hagemo deal with problems at home.
</P>
<P>
She was impressed by the discipline of Sea Org members who
visited the local church. They seemed more stable than many of the
adults in her life, and they took her seriously.
</P>
<P>
"That was a new concept for me," she said. "I felt like, Wow,
I have something to offer."
</P>
<P>
She dropped out of high school late her sophomore year and
joined the staff of the Honolulu org. Eventually the family moved
to L.A., and Hagemo and her younger sister joined the Sea Org.
</P>
<P>
The order cared little about age. Teens were given all the
responsibilities they could handle and expected to perform like
veterans. Good workers were promoted to senior positions, a
philosophy Hagemo welcomed. She was promoted from the staff dining
room to a position in a treasury office.
</P>
<P>
A friend introduced her to his brother, Dan LaFreniere, and
Hagemo found herself in her first serious relationship.
</P>
<P>
Because the Sea Org prohibits intimate contact between unmarried
staffers, the young couple skipped dating and married within a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
"People tend to get married, and get married at a young age,"
Hagemo said. "I was 17 when I got married, and it wasn't uncommon.
I had friends that were younger."
</P>
<P>
Her new husband was about two years older.
</P>
<P>
Hagemo's parents had not talked to her about reproduction or the
rhythms of her body, and neither did anyone in the Sea Org. She
didn't use birth control or keep track of her periods.
</P>
<P>
Unaware she had been pregnant eight weeks, she had a miscarriage
when she was 18. The unexpected loss woke the teenage couple to the
idea of starting a family.
</P>
<P>
Less than a year later, around Christmas 1989, Hagemo was
pregnant again.
</P>
<P>
"I told my husband first and he was really happy. We both
wanted kids so it was like, Wow, this is our first baby."
</P>
<P>
They decided to go forward with their family, even knowing what
would come next.
</P>
<P>
Proving loyalty
</P>
<P>
Hagemo had seen pregnant Sea Org members ostracized, made to
confess their sins against the group and told to make amends.
</P>
<P>
To get back in good standing, they were required to deliver an
"effective blow" on behalf of Scientology. They also had to ask
their colleagues for their signatures saying they approved their
return.
</P>
<P>
One night in the staff dining hall, before Hagemo became
pregnant, a woman asked for her signature. The woman's handwritten
statement said her pregnancy was bringing down the group but she
had redeemed herself by "terminating" it. Also in her favor, the
woman had turned in a co-worker who was wanting children.
</P>
<P>
"I was so shocked I couldn't believe what I was reading," said
Hagemo, who interpreted church founder L. Ron Hubbard's writings as
decidedly pro-family. Still, she joined others in signing the
woman's statement.
</P>
<P>
She knew a 1986 policy change required new parents be reassigned
from the Sea Org to staff local churches. The couple would have to
survive on their own but were up for the challenge. They wanted
their baby.
</P>
<P>
After Hagemo reported her pregnancy to a supervisor, two girls
who looked 14 or 15 came to her office. They were "messengers"
from upper management, senior officers held in high esteem.
</P>
<P>
They told her that by getting pregnant she was letting down L.
Ron Hubbard, the Sea Org and all mankind. The "greatest good"
would be to keep working for Scientology. Hagemo said they told her
it was "just a fetus ... just cells" growing inside her.
</P>
<P>
"I don't recall them saying, 'You need to get an abortion.' It
was just: Abortion is very much an option ... You'd be proving your
loyalty to the Sea Org."
</P>
<P>
Hagemo believes some abortions are warranted, but in her case it
would have destroyed a life "for no good reason." Her mother
survived getting pregnant in high school, she figured she could,
too. And the Sea Org would certainly get by without her.
</P>
<P>
Two days later the young "messengers" came back to see if she
had changed her mind. Ten weeks pregnant, Hagemo told them no, and
she says they berated her.
</P>
<P>
Hagemo and her husband were told they would be assigned to a
small org. Until then, she was to wear her jacket and bigger skirts
to cloak the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't want me walking around being obviously pregnant.
That was definitely pointed out to me. They didn't want other women
getting any ideas that it was okay to be pregnant."
</P>
<P>
It became impossible to hide. Friends steered clear of her, not
wanting to look like they condoned her choice. "You understand,"
she said they would tell her.
</P>
<P>
On the rare occasions someone showed interest in her baby-to-be,
she talked to them on the sly. "There was no open congratulations,
'Oh my gosh, can I feel the baby kick?' It was like, 'In my office,
shut the door.' "
</P>
<P>
At a restroom sink one day, a public relations staffer looked at
Hagemo's belly and asked with disdain, "How can you do that?"
</P>
<P>
Hagemo started crying and shaking. "I'm in this environment
where it's one of the worst things you can possibly do. I'm
married. I didn't do anything wrong. I just wanted to scream out
sometimes."
</P>
<P>
Late in her pregnancy, she was called into an office to answer
questions while connected to an e-meter. The Scientology device is
said to measure a person's mental state, including whether she is
telling the truth. Hagemo said the investigator wanted names of
people who told her it was okay to get pregnant.
</P>
<P>
Davis, the church spokesman, said Hagemo's portrayal is false.
</P>
<P>
"The church has the deepest respect for family and the creation
of a family and children. There is no hostility towards pregnant
women."
</P>
<P>
The church provided sworn declarations from one current and 10
former Sea Org members who said they or their spouses were treated
well during pregnancies and there was no pressure to have an
abortion. One was from Aaradona Walker of Santa Rosa, Calif. She
said when she got pregnant in 2008, a church staffer helped her and
her husband leave the Sea Org.
</P>
<P>
"No one tried to get me to change my mind or pressure me to do
anything else," Walker wrote. "No one tried to talk me out of
having the baby."
</P>
<P>
Hagemo said their accounts don't change what she experienced.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe some women were more fortunate when they became
pregnant. Not every young boy in the Catholic Church was molested.
That it didn't happen to some doesn't mean it didn't happen to the
others who did suffer."
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before her due date, supervisors told Hagemo she could
stop working, but she needed to stay in her room up to the delivery
and after, until she, Dan and the baby transferred to their new
assignment: Seattle.
</P>
<P>
"This allegation is absurd and is denied," Davis said.
</P>
<P>
Shelby was born at a birth center in Glendale. The young couple
brought her home to their tiny room on Scientology's L.A. campus.
</P>
<P>
"Even though it was crappy circumstances, I was so happy to
have my baby," Hagemo said. "I had no doubt in my mind that I
made the right decision, especially when she was born."
</P>
<P>
The recruiter
</P>
<P>
In the 14 years after her daughter was born, Hagemo had a second
daughter, divorced and moved near her mother in Minneapolis. She
remarried, had a son and settled in the suburb of Excelsior.
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Brad Hagemo, is an optometrist and Scientologist.
Natalie Hagemo stayed in good standing with the church by paying a
$5,000 penalty for leaving the Sea Org.
</P>
<P>
She took Scientology classes on parenting and finance and later
traveled to Los Angeles for counseling, called "auditing." By
late 2003, she reached the church's upper, or "Operating Thetan,"
levels. She felt happy and stable.
</P>
<P>
Shelby, a freshman at Minnetonka High, also was advancing in
Scientology. Church courses helped her communicate better, get past
her shyness and make friends more easily. She did well in school.
</P>
<P>
She dreamed of becoming a Scientology counselor, called an
auditor, and volunteered whenever she could at the Twin Cities org
in downtown Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
In fall 2004, a visiting Sea Org member sat Shelby down for a
recruiting pitch. If she joined, she could live her dream, she
could be an auditor. She could see her family whenever she wanted.
The church would take care of all her needs, plus she would be paid
$50 a week.
</P>
<P>
"I'd be loaded," Shelby remembers thinking. "I was, like,
'Let's do it.' I was, like, 'That sounds really cool. I just want
to call my mom,' because my mom wasn't there."
</P>
<P>
Go ahead and sign first, the recruiter said, then we'll call
mom. Shelby signed the standard pledge to stay in the Sea Org for
this and future lifetimes. She was 14.
</P>
<P>
Hagemo had to decide whether to give permission. The pressure
years earlier to have an abortion still bothered her, but she was a
loyal Scientologist and still admired the Sea Org. She knew the
recruiter, plus Shelby was so enthused.
</P>
<P>
Hagemo also knew how the church would portray it if she
resisted. She would be seen as "counter intentioned," standing in
Scientology's way.
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Okay, I'll let her go.' But I knew in my heart of
hearts that she'd be back because I knew she just wouldn't do well
in that environment."
</P>
<P>
Shelby flew to L.A. and was assigned to the EPF, the Estates
Project Force, a Sea Org boot camp of sorts. She worked on
construction projects by day and studied Scientology at night.
</P>
<P>
She had fun, but she was homesick and within a week was crying
herself to sleep. The recruiter had said Shelby could talk to her
family any time, but it took days to get approval to make a phone
call. When they finally talked, Shelby told her mom she wanted to
come home.
</P>
<P>
Mom said she would call the right people and get the discharge
process started. She got through to the EPF supervisor, who she
said turned belligerent and told her she had no right to interfere.
</P>
<P>
She told him: "I am her parent, I have legal rights. I can walk
in there right now and grab her, and there's nothing you can say
about it."
</P>
<P>
Hagemo said he told her the Sea Org wasn't bound by "wog" law,
the rules of the non-Scientology world.
</P>
<P>
"For one, I know that's not true," she said. "But to say it
to a parishioner of the church, to a mother. Anybody with a brain
knows you don't p--- off a mother."
</P>
<P>
Hagemo flew to Los Angeles to get her daughter out. She said
Shelby's EPF supervisor put his finger in her face and yelled at
her again for interfering.
</P>
<P>
Days passed. Hagemo kept asking to see her daughter. "When I
finally did see her I wasn't allowed to be alone with her."
</P>
<P>
Nor were they allowed to talk about her leaving. Shelby didn't
know where her mother stood. Would she help her get out? "I didn't
know if I was ever gonna leave," Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
Hagemo decided to take the initiative. She found Shelby at an
EPF construction site, took her to the chaplain's office and
demanded the church start the discharge process, called "routing
out."
</P>
<P>
It can take weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
Shelby had to go through an "ethics" regimen that examined her
reasons for leaving. She said she felt like she was in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
Her supervisor told her she had made a promise when she signed
her Sea Org contract and would be a liar if she broke it. Calling
her mom was a mistake. Leaving would be a huge mistake.
</P>
<P>
"He flipped my chair around to face him and he got in my face
and started yelling at me about how I was being really rude and how
I need to knock it off."
</P>
<P>
The church disputed their account. "Shelby routed out of the
Sea Org when she put in a request to do so," Davis said.
</P>
<P>
He added: "No Sea Org member has ever been subjected to
'intimidation.' "
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after Shelby first asked to leave, the church let her
go. About 11 one night, a door near the Sea Org canteen opened and
she walked out. The next day, mother and daughter flew home to
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
Questions but no answers
</P>
<P>
Not once during those two weeks did Hagemo think about running
off with her daughter or calling authorities to assert her legal
rights as a parent. She said she wanted to handle the problem by
getting the church to abide by its own policies.
</P>
<P>
She was struck by the belligerence of the Sea Org officer in
L.A. She wondered if he was one rogue staffer or a reflection of
church management.
</P>
<P>
Hagemo took a step the church forbids: She searched the Internet
for unauthorized information on Scientology.
</P>
<P>
She found rumors of "forced abortions" that had dogged the
church for years. Other accounts of "disconnection" told how the
church encouraged members to cut off all communication with
relatives and friends who question Scientology.
</P>
<P>
Hagemo still was distressed over how she was treated when she
was pregnant in the Sea Org, and the Internet raised more
questions. But for her, the benefits she got from Scientology still
outweighed all that.
</P>
<P>
She and Shelby kept taking Scientology courses. Shelby went back
to high school and worked nights at the Twin Cities org, a much
lighter commitment than the Sea Org. She was 16 and set her sights
on becoming a Scientology auditor and course supervisor.
</P>
<P>
Hagemo supported her daughter. She also spearheaded the church's
drug awareness campaign in the Twin Cities. She kept her doubts
about church management to herself.
</P>
<P>
"The church is good at making you think you're the only one who
feels that way," she said. "You don't talk about it with your
friends because they'll rat you out to the church for bringing it
up."
</P>
<P>
She likened it to staying in a failing marriage because there's
too much to lose. "There were some good times. At one point you
were in love. You got butterflies from that person.
</P>
<P>
"Now you're just nothing but unhappy around them. But you keep
wanting to hold on. It's human nature."
</P>
<P>
By her count, members of her church had tried to take her
daughter twice. She said they would try a third time.
</P>
<P>
'I thought it was normal'
</P>
<P>
Shelby graduated high school in spring 2008 and traveled to
Clearwater to be trained as a church staffer. She was 17.
</P>
<P>
She audited people, supervised course rooms and loved it.
</P>
<P>
"I got to help a lot of people. I thought it was like the
greatest thing in the world."
</P>
<P>
Other parts were not so great. Besides the training she agreed
to, she had to do the work of a full-fledged Sea Org member. She
was told to press parishioners to buy Scientology materials and to
make donations. Sometimes, to keep her numbers up, Shelby donated
money her mom had sent from home.
</P>
<P>
Many nights after 10, Shelby called parishioners the world over
to get them to buy extension courses. She didn't meet her quotas
and was constantly in "ethics" trouble.
</P>
<P>
Some days, she got only beans and rice for lunch and dinner.
Meal times were cut to 15 minutes. She cleaned bathrooms and other
spaces through the night and often got by on four or five hours of
sleep. Bosses yelled at her.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was normal at that point," Shelby said of the
punishments, "because it happens to you so much, little by little,
that you think: Okay, this is supposed to happen. I brought it on
myself. My statistics are down so I should be on rice and beans
</P>
<P>
"It kind of sucked when you had to do it but, you know, I just
did it because Scientology was so worth it."
</P>
<P>
Meantime, her mother's doubts were growing. The Hagemos and
other Twin Cities parishioners were getting frequent and demanding
pitches to donate money and buy books, CDs and DVDs. The church
asked for money several times a day and late at night, by phone and
by text. Every time Hagemo entered the Twin Cities org, she said,
someone asked her to donate.
</P>
<P>
By January 2009, she'd had enough. She complained, and a church
official said raising money was "command intention" from upper
management.
</P>
<P>
Davis, the church spokesman, responded by citing the church's
policy on donations: "Parishioners give voluntarily to support
their religion as they have always done."
</P>
<P>
He said Shelby was never punished in Clearwater and was not
deprived of sleep. All staffers in Clearwater "must get proper
sleep and nutrition in order to study in accordance with scriptural
requirements."
</P>
<P>
Last June, Hagemo and her husband read "The Truth Rundown,"
the St. Petersburg Times' accounts of high-level church defectors
who said they had witnessed physical and mental abuse within the
church's top management. Hagemo, her husband, her mother and
stepfather decided to leave the church.
</P>
<P>
The only problem was Shelby. She was still in Clearwater,
training and working for the church  a 19-year-old adult who could
make her own decisions. If her family were disaffected, the church
would tell Shelby to sever relations with all of them.
</P>
<P>
Hagemo decided not to tell anyone about her break from the
church until Shelby came home for Christmas. But church officials
in Minnesota could tell the family was having doubts.
</P>
<P>
Shelby's supervisors pushed hard for her to stay in Clearwater
over the holiday. They said she couldn't be replaced, she would be
a slacker if she left.
</P>
<P>
She called her mom, crying.
</P>
<P>
I don't want to go home  I should stay  I have big
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Hagemo recalled: "I just realized then like, Wow, who are you?
If you're so happy with your decision to stay there, then why are
you crying?"
</P>
<P>
A church official in Minnesota sent Shelby a list of "bad
indicators" about her family:
</P>
<P>
Her mom went online and found incorrect information about abuse
in the church.
</P>
<P>
Her mom and stepfather went on a date instead of attending a
church event.
</P>
<P>
Her grandmother, a veteran Scientologist, was baptized a
Christian.
</P>
<P>
An ethics officer in Clearwater told Shelby she should not go
home to that environment. Not even for the Christmas holiday, which
was to include a long-planned trip to Mexico with her biological
father, no longer a practicing Scientologist. He threatened to fly
to Clearwater to get her, and the church let Shelby leave.
</P>
<P>
Hagemo said her daughter came home withdrawn and exhausted. She
had bulging veins behind one knee that a doctor said came from
standing for hours. Shelby said she worked 70-hour weeks.
</P>
<P>
But she was still wavering. Her family's disavowal of the church
seemed sudden and "psycho."
</P>
<P>
Hagemo wanted Shelby to decide her own future in the church but
saw signs her daughter wasn't thinking for herself. Shelby wanted
to call a superior in Clearwater for guidance on whether to come
back there. She told her mom: "He'll tell me what to do."
</P>
<P>
Shelby was still uncertain when she left to spend the holiday
with her father in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
In a three-sentence e-mail sent Dec. 28, 2009, Hagemo and her
husband notified Scientology officials that they were leaving the
church. Their note concluded: "We remain Scientologists
independent of the Church of Scientology."
</P>
<P>
That day a church official contacted Shelby in Mexico on
Facebook and offered her a place to stay in Minnesota. Furious,
Hagemo fired off e-mails demanding the official stay away from her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
"What church attempts to break up and create rifts within a
family?" she wrote.
</P>
<P>
After Shelby returned from Mexico, her mother talked to her
about human rights.
</P>
<P>
"No one has a right to keep you from your family. No one has a
right to deprive you of food. No one has a right to deprive you of
sleep like that. It's a punishment and it's a human rights abuse."
</P>
<P>
That registered with Shelby, Hagemo said. "For her, labeling it
for what it was made all the difference in the world."
</P>
<P>
In January, Shelby left the church, too.
</P>
<P>
"Over my life in Scientology, I've had a lot of wins and I did
really well." she said. "But one common thing that's always
happened in the church is they've always tried to do something to
disconnect me from some part of my family."
</P>
<P>
In conversations with Shelby early this year, Hagemo eased into
the subject of how she was pressured to abort Shelby 20 years ago.
Her reaction? She had seen enough of the Sea Org that she wasn't
surprised.
</P>
<P>
Church spokesman Davis said mother and daughter made their own
choices, the church didn't force them to do anything. Now, he said,
Hagemo is "rewriting history to justify her decision to leave
Scientology."
</P>
<P>
Hagemo said she sees a years-long pattern of church interference
and control. It started in 1990 with pressure to abort Shelby,
followed in 2004 by the Sea Org trying to keep Shelby from leaving
and in 2009 by the church trying to keep her from family.
</P>
<P>
"That's three times that they tried to take my daughter,"
Hagemo said. "I mean, call me an idiot for putting up with it for
that long.
</P>
<P>
"It's a process that you go through. For some people it happens
quicker, for some it takes a couple of years to really face it  I
made excuses for so much."

USDA RECONSIDERS FIRING OF GA. OFFICIAL OVER SPEECH ON RACE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ATLANTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Wednesday he
is reconsidering his department's decision to fire a Georgia
official in wake of new details about her controversial speech to
the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
Vilsack said in a statement early Wednesday morning that he will
"conduct a thorough review and consider additional facts" about
his decision to ask Shirley Sherrod to resign. Washington's
apparent reversal came hours after a video of Sherrod's full speech
was released, and the director of rural development in Georgia was
defended by the white couple at the center of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
The full, uncut video of a federal agricultural official's NAACP
speech purporting racial scheming, told a different story than the
barely three-minute snippet that cost Sherrod her job.
</P>
<P>
Despite admitting in the edited version of the taping that she
once withheld help to the couple on the basis of race, Sherrod was
defended Tuesday by the wife of a white Georgia farmer.
</P>
<P>
Sherrod "kept us out of bankruptcy," said Eloise Spooner, 82,
of Iron City in southwest Georgia. Spooner, in an interview with
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, added she considers Sherrod a
"friend for life." She and her husband, Roger Spooner, approached
Sherrod for help in 1986 when Sherrod worked for a nonprofit that
assisted farmers.
</P>
<P>
Sherrod, who is African-American, was asked to resign Monday
night by a USDA official after videotaped comments she made in
March at a local NAACP banquet surfaced on the Web. Recounting her
dealings with the Spooners, Sherrod said she didn't help them as
much as she could because of their race.
</P>
<P>
But a review of the entire 43-minute, 15-second speech --
released Tuesday on the NAACP website -- showed that Sherrod was
giving a cautionary tale about the evils of racial separation.
</P>
<P>
"When I made that commitment (at age 17 years old to remain in
Georgia and help people), I was making that commitment to black
people, and to black people only," Sherrod said nearly 15 minutes
into the recording, just seconds before the segment that brought
her trouble. "But you know, God will ... put things in your path
so that you realize that the struggle was really about poor
people."
</P>
<P>
Next, Sherrod would say the words that eventually led to her
losing her job.
</P>
<P>
"(The white farmer) was trying to show me he was superior to
me," she said, recalling the day some 24 years ago. "I knew what
he was doing, but he had to come to me for help."
</P>
<P>
Eloise Spooner said as far as she's concerned Sherrod worked
tirelessly to help the couple hold onto their land as they faced
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Vilsack issued a statement Tuesday saying the controversy made
Sherrod's position as a rural development director, a job she was
appointed to last March, untenable. But Vilsack said Wednesday that
after learning more about what Sherrod actually said, he would
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
Vilsack said in a statement early Wednesday that he will
"conduct a thorough review and consider additional facts" about
his decision to ask Sherrod to resign.
</P>
<P>
The NAACP, which had released a statement Monday critical of
Sherrod, backtracked Tuesday, saying it was "snookered" by Andrew
Breitbart, whose website biggovernment.com released the edited
video. Breitbart did not respond to a request seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
"Having reviewed the full tape, spoken to Ms. Sherrod, and most
importantly heard the testimony of the white farmers mentioned in
this story, we now believe the organization that edited the
documents did so with the intention of deceiving millions of
Americans," NAACP President Ben Jealous said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The tape of Ms. Sherrod's speech at an NAACP banquet was
deliberately edited to create a false impression of racial bias,
and to create a controversy where none existed. This just shows the
lengths to which extremist elements will go to discredit legitimate
opposition," Jealous said
</P>
<P>
In the video, Sherrod told the crowd at the NAACP banquet in
Douglas, Ga., that she didn't do everything she could to help a
white farmer whom she said was condescending when he came to her
for aid.
</P>
<P>
"What he didn't know while he was taking all that time trying
to show me he was superior to me was, I was trying to decide just
how much help I was going to give him," Sherrod said on the video.
"I was struggling with the fact that so many black people had lost
their farmland, and here I was faced with having to help a white
person save their land. So I didn't give him the full force of what
I could do. I did enough."
</P>
<P>
Sherrod, in her first interview after the clip surfaced, told
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution the video was selectively edited.
</P>
<P>
While she soon admitted as she told her story that she referred
the Spooners to a white lawyer so "his own kind would help him,"
she followed that admission with a revelation that was omitted from
the two-minute, 36-second excerpt of the speech posted by
Breitbart's group.
</P>
<P>
Sherrod told the crowd that she discovered the white lawyer took
their money for six months, but did nothing to help them.
</P>
<P>
"This lawyer told them, 'ya'll are getting old ... why don't
you just let go of the farm,"' she said. "I could not believe he
said that to them."
</P>
<P>
Sherrod said she'd learned her lesson.
</P>
<P>
"It's about the poor," Sherrod said, just over 20 minutes into
the speech. "It made me see it really was about those who have,
versus those who don't ... black, white or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
"It made me realize that I needed to work to help poor people
... those who don't have access the way others have."
</P>
<P>
She said the incident helped her get beyond issues of race.
</P>
<P>
"And I went on to work with many more white farmers," she
said. "The story helped me realize that race is not the issue,
it's about the people who have and the people who don't."
</P>
<P>
Sherrod accused the USDA of cowering to right-wing media.
</P>
<P>
"They were just looking at what the Tea Party and what Fox
(News) said, and thought it was too (politically) dangerous for
them," Sherrod said.

U.S. SAID TO PLAN EASING OF RULES FOR TRAVEL TO CUBA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Obama administration is planning to expand
opportunities for Americans to travel to Cuba, the latest step
aimed at encouraging more contact between people in both countries,
while leaving intact the decades-old embargo against the island's
Communist government, according to congressional and administration
officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials, who asked not to be identified because they had
not been authorized to discuss the policy before it was announced,
said it was meant to loosen restrictions on academic, religious and
cultural groups that were adopted under President George W. Bush,
and return to the "people to people" policies followed under
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Those policies, officials said, fostered robust exchanges
between the United States and Cuba, allowing groups -- including
universities, sports teams, museums and chambers of commerce -- to
share expertise as well as life experiences.
</P>
<P>
Policy analysts said the intended changes would mark a
significant shift in Cuba policy. In early 2009, President Barack
Obama lifted restrictions on travel and remittances only for
Americans with relatives on the island.
</P>
<P>
Congressional aides cautioned that some administration officials
still saw the proposals as too politically volatile to announce
until after the coming midterm elections, and they said revisions
could still be made.
</P>
<P>
But others said the policy, which does not need legislative
approval, would be announced before Congress returned from its
break in mid-September, partly to avoid a political backlash from
outspoken groups within the Cuban American lobby -- backed by Sen.
Robert Menendez, D-N.J. -- that oppose any softening in Washington's
position toward Havana.
</P>
<P>
Those favoring the change said that with a growing number of
polls showing that Cuban-Americans' attitudes toward Cuba had
softened as well, the administration did not expect much of a
backlash.
</P>
<P>
"They have made the calculation that if you put a smarter Cuba
policy on the table, it will not harm us in the election cycle,"
said one Democratic congressional aide who has been working with
the administration on the policy. "That, I think, is what animates
this."
</P>
<P>
Menendez, in a statement, objected to the anticipated changes.
"This is not the time to ease pressure on the Castro regime," he
said, referring to President Raul Castro of Cuba, who took office
in 2006 after his brother, Fidel, fell ill. Menendez added that
promoting travel would give Havana a "much need infusion of
dollars that will only allow the Castro brothers to extend their
reign of oppression."
</P>
<P>
In effect, the new policy would expand current channels for
travel to Cuba, rather than create new ones. Academic, religious
and cultural groups are now allowed to travel under very tight
rules. For example, students wanting to study in Cuba are required
to stay at least 10 weeks. And only accredited universities can
apply for academic visas.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, such restrictions would be eased,
officials said. And academic institutions, including research and
advocacy groups and museums, would be able to seek licenses for as
long as two years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the administration is also planning to allow
flights to Cuba from more cities than the three -- Miami, New York,
and Los Angeles -- currently permitted. And there are proposals, the
officials said, to allow all Americans to send remittances or
charitable donations to churches, schools and human rights groups
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the measures were partly a response to
pressure from an unlikely alliance of liberal political groups and
conservative business associations -- led by Sen. John Kerry, head
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- who have been pushing
Congress to lift all restrictions on travel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Others described it as a nod to Castro's stunning decision last
month to begin releasing dozens of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"It's a way of fostering greater opening and exchange without a
bruising battle with a much-needed political ally in an election
year," said Christopher Sabatini, senior policy director at the
Council of the Americas. "But it can still be legitimately couched
as a way of supporting democracy and human rights by allowing
independent exchange and thought."
</P>
<P>
As with everything concerning Cuba, the new policy seems fraught
with complications. Obama, who came to office promising to open new
channels of engagement with Cuba, has so far had limited those new
openings to Cuban-Americans, partly because of political concerns,
and also because his administration's attention had been focused on
more pressing foreign policy matters, including two wars.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the administration believes this will produce
palpable change in the short term," said Julia Sweig of the
Council on Foreign Relations. "But it's a way over the long term
to allow Americans and Cubans to have contact, even as their
governments continue to hash out a lot of seriously thorny
issues."
</P>
<P>
High on America's list of issues is winning the release of an
American contractor who was detained in Cuba nine months ago when
authorities said they caught him distributing satellite telephones
to Jewish dissident groups.
</P>
<P>
The contractor, Alan P. Gross, had gone to Cuba without the
proper visa as part of longstanding program by the organization
USAID, in which development workers conduct activities aimed at
strengthening groups that oppose the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with a relationship that's so contorted, it
would take another 50 years of incremental steps to pull it apart
and reassemble it in a constructive way," said Robert Pastor, a
professor of international relations at American University. "Even
then, we're having trouble taking baby steps, when what we need is
a giant leap."

ITALIAN POLICE SEIZE $1.9 BILLION IN MAFIA-LINKED ASSETS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Italian police seized $1.9 billion in assets
belonging to a Sicilian businessman linked to the Mafia in the
country's biggest blow against organized crime, Italy's interior
minister said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The businessman, Vito Nicastri, mainly operates in the
alternative-energy business and has already been involved in
several investigations focused on Mafia infiltration in the
construction of windmills in Sicily's Trapani province and on links
between the Mafia and 'Ndrangheta crime associations in Calabria,
according to a statement by Rome Anti-Mafia Directorate. Italian
authorities seized Nicastri's assets to investigate him, but he has
not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
The seized assets included more than 100 properties around
Sicily, 43 companies operating mainly in the wind- and solar-power
industry -- some with headquarters in Luxembourg -- as well as luxury
cars, a 46-foot catamaran, bank accounts and securities.
</P>
<P>
"This is the proof of the fact that the Mafia is dynamic and
able to interpret the new needs of our society," said Francesco
Forgione, president of the parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission in
the previous government and author of the book "Mafia Exports."
</P>
<P>
"They all used to work a lot in construction and now the
Camorra operates in the waste business" -- he added, referring to
the Neapolitan crime syndicate -- "whereas the Mafia's in the
alternative-energy business."
</P>
<P>
The interior minister, Roberto Maroni, said in a television
interview Tuesday that Nicastri, 54, was "close to the Mafia boss
Matteo Messina Denaro, currently at large."
</P>
<P>
The Trapani investigation is part of a larger government
strategy targeting people investigators consider to be linked to a
new leader of Cosa Nostra, Matteo Messina Denaro. Originally from
Trapani, he has been a fugitive since 1993. He is known as the
"Boss of the Bosses" and the "Playboy Boss" because of his
penchant for fast cars, women and luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
In 2008, the government began stepping up its investigations
into organized crime and introduced laws that allow investigators
to seize assets connected to Mafia business before the criminal
trial starts. Several important raids against organized crime have
been carried out by police all over the country and have involved
different economic sectors, including health care, construction,
retailing and finance.
</P>
<P>
In August, Maroni said Italian police had seized 15 billion
euros in assets from organized-crime groups in the previous 14
months.
</P>
<P>
"On average, we arrested eight Mafia members a day and one of
Italy's most wanted men a month," Maroni said to Italian press
representatives.
</P>
<P>
However, critics say the government is working at
cross-purposes. Earlier this year, the government tried to pass a
bill that would restrict wiretaps used in criminal investigations,
a tool that many consider vital to fight organized crime.

ROBERT KATZ, WHO WROTE OF NAZI MASSACRE IN ITALY, DIES AT 77
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Katz, an author and screenwriter who incurred the wrath
of the Vatican by accusing Pope Pius XII of failing to act to stave
off a Nazi massacre of Italians in 1944, died Wednesday in
Montevarchi, Italy, northeast of Siena. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
The cause was complications following cancer surgery, said his
wife, Beverly Gerstel Katz. Katz lived in Pieve a Presciano, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Katz, an American who lived in Italy for much of the last 50
years, wrote nonfiction books, novels and screenplays, many set
against the backdrop of 20th-century Italian history. He was
attracted to bloodshed and high drama.
</P>
<P>
One book, "Days of Wrath: The Ordeal of Aldo Moro" (1980), is
a journalistic recreation of the kidnapping of Moro, an Italian
statesman and former prime minister, from the center of Rome by
left-wing militants known as the Red Brigade, and of his eventual
murder. A 1990 book, "Naked by the Window," is a thoroughgoing
account of the 1985 death of the artist Ana Mendieta, who either
committed suicide by leaping from her 34th-floor Greenwich Village
apartment or was thrown from the window and killed by her husband,
the sculptor Carl Andre. Andre was tried for and acquitted in the
case.
</P>
<P>
Katz's 1977 novel, "Ziggurat," concerned terrorist
blackmailers threatening to detonate an atomic bomb at the North
Pole, and his screenplay for the 1976 thriller "The Cassandra
Crossing," which starred Richard Harris, Ava Gardner, Burt
Lancaster and O.J. Simpson, involved a plague-infected terrorist
fleeing the authorities on a passenger train.
</P>
<P>
But Katz's most frequent subject was the Holocaust, especially
as it pertained to Italy. In 2003, he published "The Battle for
Rome: The Germans, the Allies, the Partisans and the Pope,
September 1943-June 1944," an account of the German occupation of
Rome from the fall of Mussolini to the city's liberation. In many
ways it expanded on his first book, "Death in Rome," the one that
had brought him notoriety.
</P>
<P>
"Death in Rome" (1967) was a reconstruction of the infamous
Ardeatine Caves massacre of 1944, when the Nazis, in reprisal for
an attack by Italian resistance fighters on a German-speaking
police battalion, herded 335 Italian men -- prisoners and civilians
-- to a series of man-made caves on the outskirts of Rome and shot
them. In his book, Katz, citing evidence he later called strong but
circumstantial, said Pius had learned of the planned executions 19
hours before they occurred but chose to remain silent, an
accusation that was immediately denied by the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a book of history but a polemic in which the
special interests of the author are dominant and in conflict with
the interests of research and presentation of the facts," a
Vatican spokesman said at the time. (Among documents later released
by the Vatican, one indicated that Pius had, in fact, been made
aware of the Nazi reprisal, though only five hours before it took
place.)
</P>
<P>
The book was made into a film, "Massacre in Rome," in 1973.
The next year, in a legal proceeding initiated by the niece of
Pius, who had died in 1958, Katz along with the film's director,
George P. Cosmatos, and producer, Carlo Ponti, were charged with
"defaming the memory" of Pius. They were found guilty and given
suspended sentences. (Katz's was 14 months.) After several appeals
and counterappeals, the charges were set aside in 1980 by Italy's
highest court.
</P>
<P>
Katz was never one to shy away from assigning blame in
historical events or from drawing other potent conclusions, and his
work, though often admired for his research and writing style, also
drew fervent objections. His 1969 book, "Black Sabbath," about
the rounding up of 1,000 Roman Jews in October 1943 for liquidation
in Auschwitz, was praised as an "elaborately documented history"
by Michael M. Bernet, writing in The New York Times Book Review.
But Bernet also wrote that "Katz's attitude to Judaism, Jewry,
Zionism and Israel is hostile and uninformed, if not downright
offensive."
</P>
<P>
Robert Katz was born on June 27, 1933, in Brooklyn, where his
parents ran a grocery. He attended Brooklyn College and worked as a
writer on the staff of the American Cancer Society. He wrote
"Death in Rome" in New York City after a first trip to Italy; he
and his wife, whom he married in 1957, moved there permanently
after it was published.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife, he is survived by his sons Jonathan and
Stephen, both of Rome; his brothers Alan, of Manhattan, and Howard,
of Merrick, N.Y.; and two grandchildren.

NORRIS CHURCH MAILER, ARTIST AND WRITER, DIES AT 61
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norris Church Mailer, a woman bred in the rural poverty of
Arkansas who married Norman Mailer and managed his career and
family life over three decades while carving out her own niche as a
writer, died Sunday at her home in New York. She was 61.
</P>
<P>
The cause was the gastrointestinal cancer that she had battled
for 11 years, said her son John Buffalo Mailer.
</P>
<P>
Mailer, who had grown up as Barbara Jean Davis, was a high
school art teacher, former pickle-factory worker and divorced
mother when Norman Mailer came to Russellville, Ark., in 1975 to
plug his book-length reflection on Marilyn Monroe. New York-bred,
Harvard-educated, with the first of two Pulitzer Prizes to his
credit, he was almost as celebrated for his brawling egocentrism
and intellectual provocations as he was for his novels. He was also
twice her age and by that point had been married four times.
</P>
<P>
But as a Book-of-the-Month Club member, she was eager that he
sign her copy of "Marilyn." After a few moments of conversation,
he was enchanted. She found him "easily the most interesting man I
had ever met." She was to give another motive for their magnetic
attraction.
</P>
<P>
"Sex was the cord that bound us together," she wrote.
</P>
<P>
Within months, she moved to New York where, as she wrote in "A
Ticket to the Circus," the memoir she published this year, Norman
Mailer became "the Henry Higgins to my Eliza Doolittle." She
worked for Wilhelmina Models and changed her name. Norris echoed
her first husband's surname, but it was Norman Mailer, who died in
2007 at 84, who dreamed up Church because he was struck by her
having attended Free Will Baptist services three times a week as a
child.
</P>
<P>
She gave birth to John Buffalo in 1978 and spent much of her
time taking care of him; her first child, Matthew; and several of
Norman Mailer's seven other children. Norman Mailer, whom she
married in 1980, was by all accounts an attentive father, and at
one point seven people were squeezed into the Mailers' apartment.
All nine children were rounded up for summers in Maine and later
Provincetown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
She was able to enter her husband's potentially daunting orbit
of the famous and the accomplished -- people like Woody Allen, Bob
Dylan and Jackie Onassis. She also organized her husband's social
and family life and defended him against antagonists, like
feminists offended by his 1971 volume, "The Prisoner of Sex."
</P>
<P>
"To me, the humor and irony was inherent," she later wrote.
"But you can't transfer the twinkle in the eye to the page, so a
lot of people treated everything he said as perfectly serious, like
his famous comment that women should be kept in cages. Who would
think he was serious about that?"
</P>
<P>
At one point the two nearly split over Norman Mailer's
infidelities (one mistress, Carole Mallory, recently wrote a memoir
of her eight-year affair), but he pleaded with her to stay, and she
did, wanting to hold the family together. She also confided in a
recent interview that she could not think of a single person she
would rather have been with.
</P>
<P>
She worked hard at making her own cultural mark. She had nine
one-woman art shows and, according to John Buffalo, appeared in
several plays. Early in their relationship she showed her husband
100 pages of a novel; his response, she recalled, was, "It's not
as bad as I thought it would be." She put it away, but it came out
in 2000 as "Windchill Summer," a story about coming of age in
Arkansas during the Vietnam War. In 2007 she published a sequel,
"Cheap Diamonds," about an aspiring model from Arkansas who
arrives in New York in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Whatever her own achievements, friends said she seldom lost her
open-hearted, down-to-earth sensibility.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not an intellectual," she said in an interview this year
with The New York Times. "I pick up People magazine instead of
TheNew York Review of Books and read it first. That's just a fact.
I tried very hard to make myself more literate, and I'm not a
stupid woman, but some things interest me and some things don't."
</P>
<P>
Although her parents were from Arkansas, she was born on Jan.
31, 1949, in the state of Washington, where her father, James
Davis, took a job building a dam while putting his family up in a
trailer. By the time she was 2 they had returned to Arkansas, and
she grew up in Atkins in a home that had an outhouse.
</P>
<P>
At the age of 3 she won the title of Little Miss Little Rock. At
20 she married her high school sweetheart, Larry Norris, but they
divorced after five years. In addition to John Buffalo and Matthew,
survivors include her stepchildren, Susan, Danielle, Elizabeth,
Kate, Michael, Stephen and Maggie Mailer; and her mother, Gaynell
Davis.
</P>
<P>
Before she met Mailer, she claimed, she had a fling with the
then-unmarried Bill Clinton. In her memoir she told the story with
characteristic wit. A friend who was in politics told her when
Clinton was president, "I guess he slept with every woman in
Arkansas except you."
</P>
<P>
"Sorry," she replied. "I'm afraid he got us all."

CHRISTIAN WOMAN SEEKS PARDON IN PAKISTAN BLASPHEMY CASE WAQAR GILLANI CONTRIBUTED REPORTING FROM LAHORE, PAKISTAN.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Christian woman who was sentenced to
death by a municipal court for blasphemy against Islam could be
pardoned in the next few days by the president, a senior government
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Asia Bibi, 45, an agricultural worker and mother of five, is the
first woman to be sentenced to death for blasphemy, according to
human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab province -- where Bibi has
been held in jail for more than a year -- said he had forwarded a
petition presenting the facts of the case to President Asif Ali
Zardari on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taseer, a political ally of Zardari, said he believed that Bibi
had been unfairly treated since she was arrested in 2009.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the president will pardon Asia in a day or two,"
Taseer said.
</P>
<P>
The case against Bibi began in the fields of Ittan Wali, a
village 60 miles west of the city of Lahore, when agricultural
workers picking berries with her protested that she had been asked
by a landlord to fetch water for the workers to drink.
</P>
<P>
The other workers declined to touch the water bowl because Bibi,
a Christian, had carried the container, according to her husband,
Ashiq Masih, and other accounts.
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly she saw men and women walking towards her with angry
gestures," Masih, a laborer, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
"They started beating her and shouting that she had made
derogatory remarks against the Prophet Muhammad," he said.
</P>
<P>
A mob dragged his wife to a local police station, and there she
was charged with blasphemy and locked up, he said.
</P>
<P>
"My wife has not done anything," he said.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the guilty verdict this month, Judge Naveed Iqbal
ruled in a Punjab municipal court that the woman had not been
wrongly accused, saying in the verdict "the chances of false
implication of the accused are totally ruled out."
</P>
<P>
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has documented scores of
cases in which men have been harassed for being a Christian, or for
being a member of the Ahmedi sect, a minority group within Islam,
and then accused of blasphemy. The mere fact of being a Christian
or an Ahmedi in Pakistan makes an individual vulnerable to the
draconian blasphemy laws, the commission says.
</P>
<P>
Adding pressure to the Pakistan authorities to overturn the
sentence of Bibi, Pope Benedict XVI appealed last week for the
woman to be freed unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for President Zardari said that the petition from
Taseer had not reached the president's office yet.
</P>
<P>
"We know what to do," Farhatullah Babar, the president's aide,
said. "The president will take an appropriate decision when the
mercy petition is received."
</P>
<P>
It was also possible that the Lahore High Court could overturn
the decision, lawyers familiar with blasphemy cases said.
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups say more than 20 men have been sentenced to
death under the blasphemy law, most of them Christians.
</P>
<P>
None of these people have been executed. Under the blasphemy
law, a high court must confirm the death sentence from a lower
court, lawyers say. Some of those accused remained on death row
awaiting appeal to the high court, they say. Some mainstream
Muslims have also been charged with blasphemy, according to the
Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
Even if Bibi is pardoned, or if the Lahore High Court overturned
the sentence, there are concerns about her safety. Many people
acquitted on blasphemy charges continue to be hounded and are
forced to move, change their identity or hide, the commission says.
</P>
<P>
A 22-year-old man acquitted on blasphemy charges was shot to
death last week, two days after being released from jail. The man,
Imran Latif, was charged with desecrating the Quran.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial titled "Pakistan's Salem-witch-hunt" that
blasted the blasphemy laws, the English-language Daily Times
newspaper described the shooting of Latif as "sanctioning the free
hand of murderers."
</P>
<P>
Instead of denouncing the murder of Latif, the investigating
officer in the case had said "no Muslim tolerates a man who
commits blasphemous acts," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Many attempts have been made to revise the blasphemy laws,
including during the recent military rule of President Pervez
Musharraf. But lawmakers have stalled in the face of strong
opposition from religious parties.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was founded in 1947 as a Muslim nation but one where
its founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, said its citizens could practice
all religions freely.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s under the military dictatorship of Mohammad Zia
ul-Haq, the blasphemy law was introduced as part of the
Islamization of society.
</P>
<P>
"This is not Jinnah's law," Taseer said Monday, referring to
the contradiction between the intention of the nation's founder and
the blasphemy law. "We want Jinnah's Pakistan, not a mullahs'
Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
Taseer said the government expected a backlash against Islamic
religious leaders and extremist groups if Bibi was pardoned.
</P>
<P>
"We are struggling for Pakistan's soul," he said.

FRANK BALDINO JR., FOUNDER OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, DIES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Frank Baldino Jr. who founded the pharmaceutical company
Cephalon, best known for the drug Provigil, which is used to
increase alertness, died Thursday in Philadelphia. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
The cause was complications related to leukemia, the company
said in a statement. In August, Baldino, who lived in West Chester,
Pa., had taken a leave of absence from his posts as Cephalon's
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
The company, which Baldino founded in 1987, sells a variety of
drugs, including some that are used to treat pain and sleepiness.
Besides Provigil, its best-known brands include Actiq, a
painkiller, and Gabitril, a treatment for seizure disorders.
</P>
<P>
Provigil, which was originally approved to treat sleepiness
related to narcolepsy, became a huge success, used by millions of
people, who generally found that it kept them alert with little or
none of the jitteriness associated with caffeine or the euphoria
and often addiction resulting from amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
Provigil was particularly popular with college students,
long-haul truckers and others who needed to stay awake late into
the night.
</P>
<P>
"There are no warts on this drug," Baldino said in 2002. "The
only question is how big we can make it."
</P>
<P>
By 2004, Cephalon said that 90 percent of all prescriptions for
the drug were for "off label" uses, including fatigue,
depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and sleepiness
caused by other prescription medications.
</P>
<P>
Despite its success, Cephalon had its share of run-ins with the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
In 2007, the company said it would pay $425 million to settle a
federal investigation into its sales and marketing practices and
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of federal prescription
drug laws.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has sued Cephalon,
saying it made illegal deals with generic drug companies to delay
generic competition to Provigil. Cephalon disputes that.
</P>
<P>
And the company paid $17 million to settle shareholder lawsuits
accusing Baldino and other executives of overstating the
effectiveness of an experimental drug for Lou Gehrig's disease. The
company said it had settled for reasons of expediency and denied
any wrongdoing. Seven outsiders associated with the company were
charged with insider trading.
</P>
<P>
Baldino was born May 13, 1953, and grew up in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. He graduated from Muhlenberg College in Allentown,
Pa., and received a Ph.D. in pharmacology from Temple University.
</P>
<P>
He worked for seven years in the 1980s for E.I. du Pont de
Nemours as a senior research biologist developing potential drugs.
During his career, he wrote more than 100 publications in
peer-reviewed journals, Cephalon said.
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Sandra; four sons, Jeff, James,
Douglas and Harris; a daughter, Leslie; his mother, Sally; and two
brothers, Guy and Paul.

Just Say No to Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
By Al Kamen
WASHINGTON POST-BLOOMBERG--03-17-10 0950ET
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The liberal-leaning Center for Democracy in the Americas, which regularly takes
small groups of key Hill staffers to Cuba, has a four-day trip scheduled for
March 28 to find some facts. This year, about 10 aides, mostly from the House
side, had signed up, even though there is no beach time on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
But Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez, N.J., and Bill Nelson, Fla., in a "Dear
Colleague" letter last week, urged their fellow senators not to allow their
aides to go. Last year, former senator Mel Martinez, R-Fla., met with the aides
who'd signed up to dissuade them from going. They went anyway.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make you aware of a number of serious issues in our bilateral
relationship that may affect your decision to have your staff participate in
this delegation to Cuba," Menendez and Nelson wrote in their March 9 letter.
</P>
<P>
They cited the case of Agency for International Development subcontractor Alan
Gross, who was working in Cuba on a tourist visa and possessed satellite
communications equipment, who has been held in a maximum security prison since
his arrest Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
They also noted the recent death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, "a 42-year-0ld Cuban
dissident (who) died after going on a prolonged hunger strike in protest of his
ongoing beatings at the hands of the regime's prison officials." About 200
political prisoners are brutally treated in Cuban prisons, they said.
</P>
<P>
So "to have visits to Cuba in light of these deaths and human rights abuses
sends the wrong signal to the Castro regime," they wrote. If some on "your staff
do travel to Cuba," they wrote, "we would urge them to make as a precondition
... the unfettered access to non-governmental civil society groups and activists
in order to gain an understanding of the full spectrum of life in Cuba."
</P>
<P>
We're told this trip, like previous ones, includes meetings with Catholic Church
folks, civil society people, musicians and artists, as well as government
officials. There's usually an overnight jaunt to a rural area to see how
different things are out in the campo.
</P>
<P>
Numerous organizations have sponsored bipartisan lawmaker and staff trips to
Cuba over the years. (If you're not on this one, the New America Foundation has
one going in a few weeks that will be led by former lawmakers.) U.S. citizens,
with some exceptions, generally are barred from travel to Cuba _ as opposed to
traveling to other repressive states such as North Korea, Iran, Libya, Burma,
Sudan, Laos, Saudi Arabia, China or any other country on the planet. There's
even a tourism company offering Americans trips to scenic North Korea. Go to
www.northkorea1on1.com.
</P>
<P>
Nelson went to Syria in 2006, brushing aside similar Bush White House objections
over things such as Syrian political prisoners and its alleged the assassination
of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005. He also stopped in to see the
Saudis, and he has visited with the Chicom leadership. Menendez has visited
Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, deemed "not free" on the Freedom House listings.
Unclear whether either has asked his Cuban-American constituents _ who enjoy
unlimited travel and are going regularly to visit relatives on the island _ to
forgo visiting for the moment.

Cuba's Gesture
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON POST-BLOOMBERG--07-09-10 0726ET
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following editorial appeared in Friday's Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
Cuba has pledged to let 52 of its prisoners of conscience go. We hope their
release happens, and soon. But there should be no illusions that this gesture
augurs fundamental political change on the island that the Castro brothers,
Fidel and Ra l, have ruled with an iron fist since 1959. The Castro regime has a
long history of tactical human rights concessions _ with the goal of buying time
for the regime rather than reforming it. This release would appear to fit the
pattern.
</P>
<P>
Always impoverished and unfree, revolutionary Cuba is in extra-bad shape now.
Cardinal Jaime Ortega, the usually discreet archbishop of Havana, recently
warned of "a difficult situation" that calls for "quick" changes by the
government lest "impatience and ill will" spread. The state-run economy is
reeling: Tourism and mineral exports are down, foreign debt is up, and Venezuela
is decreasingly able to help because of its own colossal mismanagement.
Meanwhile, Cuba's dissidents are gaining in daring and prestige _ domestically
and internationally. The death of prisoner of conscience Orlando Zapata Tamayo
after a 75-day hunger strike, as well as the attacks of government-backed mobs
on peaceful demonstrations by wives and mothers of political prisoners, earned
global condemnation and set back Spain's efforts to relax the European Union's
policy linking economic aid with human rights progress. Dissident Guillermo
Farinas is near death on a hunger strike of his own, demanding
</P>
<P>
freedom for 25 political prisoners who are sick.
</P>
<P>
The regime could ill afford that embarrassment. So the promised release is a
victory for Farinas. And it's no accident that it was coordinated with the
Spanish government _ or that it came a week after the House Agriculture
Committee had approved lifting the ban on U.S. tourism to the island and easing
U.S. food sales. Ra l Castro, who took over day-to-day control from his ailing
brother four years ago, undoubtedly hopes to encourage these developments, which
promise to relieve his cash crunch.
</P>
<P>
How should the United States respond? As suggested by the fact that cash-only
food exports from the United States make this country Cuba's fifth-largest
trading partner, "embargo" is already a misnomer to describe the main U.S.
policy approach. In fact, along with Venezuelan petroleum and tourism, cash
remittances from Cuban-Americans, which President Obama already has eased,
constitute one of Cuba's economic pillars. We don't generally approve of
restrictions on where Americans may travel. But the Cuba "ban" already includes
large exceptions for Cuban-Americans, trade delegations and educational
missions. Neither those visits nor the influx of Canadians and Europeans have
had the effect of liberalizing the regime _ though they have brought in hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
The 52 inmates represent fewer than one-third of Cuba's 167 political prisoners,
according to democracy advocate Freedom House. Among prisoners notably not
mentioned for release on Wednesday was Alan Gross of Potomac, Md., an Agency for
International Development contractor imprisoned in Cuba since December for the
crime of distributing cellphones and laptops in Cuba's tiny Jewish community.
And the first five prisoners to be freed reportedly are going to be forced into
exile as a condition of their release. Obama has wisely linked major changes in
U.S. sanctions to significant movement toward democracy and freedom by Havana.
That condition is still far from met.

Engineer Helped Develop the High-Speed Modem
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
By T. Rees Shapiro
WASHINGTON POST-BLOOMBERG--07-24-10 1339ET
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Rosen, an electrical engineer who in the mid-1950s helped develop the high-
speed modem, spurring revolutionary progress in the nascent industry of
telecommunications, died of congestive heart failure July 20 at his cottage in
West Bath, Maine. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
The technology behind the modem _ a device that converts data into signals that
can be passed through channels such as phone lines _ has existed in primitive
forms since the late 1940s. But in those days, phone lines carried data signals
inconsistently, and information was transmitted slowly.
</P>
<P>
While working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory
in 1958, Rosen and a colleague, Jack Harrington, patented a device that rapidly
transmitted large amounts of data over phone lines.
</P>
<P>
Their invention, "Method of Land Line Pulse Transmission," helped expand
computer networks nationwide by significantly accelerating the flow of data over
phone lines.
</P>
<P>
"One of my colleagues said, `Oh, you're going to get rich on this,' " Rosen said
in a 2004 interview with IEEE, the organization formerly known as the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
</P>
<P>
But the patent's wording was too constrained _ the work of an inept lawyer,
Rosen often said _ which allowed competitors such as AT&amp;T's Bell Labs to create
their own modems by making only minor adjustments to the patented design. Thus,
Rosen never made the fortune he thought he deserved when high-speed modems based
on his work began popping up across the United States.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Rosen's system was a crucial addition to a landmark Army defense
project during the Cold War. The SAGE program, or Semi-Automatic Ground
Environment, was a series of more than 100 radar installations spread across the
northern border of the United States. Each station sent data about incoming
planes, such as Russian bombers loaded with nuclear weapons, to centers around
the country at a rate of more than 1,800 bits per second through Mr. Rosen's
modems.
</P>
<P>
The standard maximum speed for data transmission was about 600 bps, but Rosen's
breakthrough technology allowed the military to monitor U.S. air space nearly in
real time.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, for his leadership and contributions in military communications, Rosen
was made a fellow of the IEEE, one of the most prestigious honors for engineers.
</P>
<P>
Paul Rosen was born in Boston on Jan. 4, 1922. His parents were Jewish
immigrants from Russia, and he grew up in ghettos in suburban Boston. His
father's first job in the United States was washing milk cans at a dairy.
</P>
<P>
Rosen said he became fascinated with engineering while toying with old crystal
radios as a teen-ager. At what is now Tufts University, Rosen said, he received
a "lousy education" and made money working in the school's machine shop, where
he made cast-iron ingots for 40 cents an hour. He graduated with a bachelor's
degree in electrical engineering in 1944 and joined the Navy during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
After sporadic training that included stints as an enlisted sailor and deck
officer, Rosen spent the rest of his Navy service in Guam with a logistics
company, supervising the loading and unloading ships.
</P>
<P>
The two supplies that Mr. Rosen said his company never ran out of were shaved
ice and beer.
</P>
<P>
Rosen began working at MIT in the late 1940s, where he later received a master's
degree in engineering. At the Lincoln Laboratory, he became a senior leader in
the communications and mechanical engineering divisions and oversaw the
development of radar systems, satellites and data encryption systems.
</P>
<P>
For much of his time at MIT, Rosen worked in Building 20, a site of antiwar
protests during the 1960s because the school's ROTC and several programs funded
by the Defense Department were there.
</P>
<P>
"I felt like a turkey, because here I was working my butt off and I thought
doing good work, and these guys would come around and accuse me of being a
warmonger," Rosen said in the 2004 interview.
</P>
<P>
He left the Lincoln Laboratory in 1977 and spent three years as head of the
Defense Communications Agency. He returned to the Lincoln Laboratory in 1980 and
spent four years there before retiring.
</P>
<P>
Rosen went back to school in the early 1970s for a second master's degree in
psychiatric counseling from Boston University and volunteered as a crisis and
intervention responder in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, he moved to Deerfield Beach, Fla., and taught courses on existentialism
for senior citizens at Lynn University in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
He had lived in Silver Spring, Md., since 2006.
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife of 66 years, Annette Braverman Rosen of Silver
Spring; three children, Mark Rosen of Auburn, Calif., Bruce Rosen of Newton,
Mass., and Elliot Rosen of Takoma Park, Md.; a sister; a brother; and five
grandchildren.

CHIHUAHUA, Mexico - Armed men in military uniforms stormed the law offices of
Mario Gonzalez 10 days ago and whisked him away in a pickup truck. But the
kidnappers were after much more than money.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez has since appeared in two Internet videos, sitting handcuffed in a
chair, surrounded by five commandos in black masks, as they level automatic
weapons at his head. Then the interrogation begins.
</P>
<P>
"What group do you belong to?" barks an off-camera voice.
</P>
<P>
"The group called La Linea or the Juarez Cartel," Gonzalez answers on cue.
</P>
<P>
"What is your job?"
</P>
<P>
"I am the link to the prosecutor, my sister. . . . "
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old lawyer describes to the camera how he and his sister Patricia
Gonzalez, the former state attorney general, worked for the Juarez drug cartel
and orchestrated some of the state's most sensational political murders.
</P>
<P>
Patricia Gonzalez denies her brother's charges. He was being tortured, she said.
</P>
<P>
The videos have circulated widely on social networking sites, drug-war blogs and
Twitter. The abductors have promised a third and final installment.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez's kidnapping and his forced video "confession," with its similarities
to the propaganda produced by terrorists, represent a stark escalation in a drug
war that has left 30,000 dead over the past four years. The warring cartels
often accuse government officials of corruption but rarely in such al-Qaida-
style videos.
</P>
<P>
"They did it for revenge, because I would not negotiate with criminals," said
Patricia Gonzalez, whose term as attorney general ended Oct. 3. She was seated
at the desk where her brother was kidnapped. Two truckloads of heavily armed
federal police guarded the entrance outside.
</P>
<P>
With the country's legal system unable to expose the extent of corruption that
allows criminal networks here to flourish, many war-weary Mexicans appear
willing to consider the charges made in the videos as possibly true, at least in
part.
</P>
<P>
Chihuahua Gov. Cesar Duarte Jaquez announced that the state, working with the
federal attorney general, would investigate the charges and release the results
to the public.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez described how former Chihuahua Gov. Jose Reyes Baeza and Mexican Army
Gen. Felipe Espitia, the head of military's anti-narcotics operations here, met
with top leaders of the Juarez cartel at a ranch, and along with Patricia
Gonzalez ordered the assassinations of prominent journalists and community
leaders. The victims included the lead crime reporter at El Diario newspaper in
Ciudad Juarez, a popular local Mormon leader and a rural activist who spoke out
against the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
"I ask forgiveness from God and the people for having killed so many innocent
people. We were sick with power, me, my sister, the governor and all of the
people in the Juarez cartel," an ashen-faced Gonzalez said in a rote manner in a
video uploaded Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Patricia Gonzalez arrived in office promising to reform the state's judicial
system, reduce police abuses and bring justice to the families of hundreds of
women slain in Ciudad Juarez. But Chihuahua's climate of criminal impunity has
only worsened.
</P>
<P>
In Ciudad Juarez, police and prosecutors have identified suspects in only 3
percent of the more than 2,000 homicides committed here between January and
August this year, according to tallies by El Diario. "Our justice system has
collapsed," Gonzalez said, insisting the state needs to triple the number of
prosecutors and state police.
</P>
<P>
Patricia Gonzalez acknowledged that many might believe the worst about public
officials. "They believe there are close ties between drug trafficking and
government institutions," she said.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said her brother was kidnapped by a man who calls himself "El Puma
Original," leader of a death squad under the command of the Sinaloa cartel,
which is at war with the Juarez mafia for control of the state.
</P>
<P>
She suspects El Puma played the role of grand inquisitor in the videos. A
comment posted by an El Puma on a popular website boasted that the captors would
make Mario Gonzalez "sing."
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez assumes that El Puma is a former police officer. She said she made many
enemies during her six years as attorney general. "We fired 350 police and
prosecutors," Gonzalez said. "I think there are clear elements that indicate
that the state police are involved in my brother's kidnapping."

Author and Painter Norris Church Mailer Dies
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
By Martin Weil
WASHINGTON POST-BLOOMBERG--11-23-10 1046ET
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norris Church Mailer, who was the sixth and final wife of Pulitzer Prize-winning
novelist Norman Mailer and was also a model, a painter and a respected author in
her own right, died Nov. 21 at her home in Brooklyn, N.Y. She was 61.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Mailer had been contending for a decade with gastrointestinal cancer and
had undergone numerous surgeries and extensive treatments.
</P>
<P>
In her 20s, divorced and the mother of a small child, she was an art teacher in
Arkansas when she met Norman Mailer. They married in 1980, and through her
celebrated husband she met Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Imelda Marcos, Woody
Allen and Fidel Castro, among others.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Mrs. Mailer demonstrated the emotional resources to organize her
husband's often-tempestuous life, defend his reputation and withstand his
critiques of her work as well as to combat the debilitation of disease.
</P>
<P>
In addition to dealing with the routine challenges of living with the oft-
married literary lion and his many offspring, she overcame the devastation of
discovering that after years together he had been straying from the path of
monogamy.
</P>
<P>
That was just one of the events that made it plausible that, after two novels,
she could produce "A Ticket to the Circus," an evocatively named 2010 memoir
that could be considered worthy of a place among the chronicles of American life
and lives.
</P>
<P>
Her husband, who died in 2007, was inevitably a part of the book, but reviewers
noted that it was about her, and the fascinations of her life, which included
youthful employment in a pickle factory and a later romance with an Arkansas
politician named Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Its charms were seen as those of the granddaughter of sharecroppers who
flourished in a more glamorous world and who, when asked which of her husband's
many wives she was, had the wit and grit to reply: "The last one."
</P>
<P>
A review in The Washington Post described the memoir as the story of "a girl on
her own who took a big chance." She made her way, at least partly, according to
the review, as "the perfect combination of sex symbol and gangly good friend."
</P>
<P>
Although her family was from Arkansas, she was born in Washington state, where
her father was working on a construction project. Her birth name was Barbara
Jean Davis, and her birth date was Jan. 31, 1949. Norman Mailer was born the
same day 26 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
Religion played a major role in her upbringing in Atkins, Ark. Her middle name,
Church, was given to her by Mailer in recognition of that. Norris was the
surname of her first husband, Larry Norris.
</P>
<P>
In 1975, she was teaching art and Mailer had come to Russellville, Ark., while
promoting his new book on Marilyn Monroe. She had a copy and decided to get it
signed.
</P>
<P>
Described by a reader of her memoir as an "intelligent bombshell," she attracted
the then-married author almost instantly. She said that she found him "just the
most interesting person I've ever met."
</P>
<P>
They may have seemed an unlikely couple, but, she said, "you really can't pick
who you're attracted to."
</P>
<P>
Somehow, she said, "it worked out."
</P>
<P>
From his earlier wives, Mailer had seven children. She had one by her first
husband, and she and Mailer had a son together, John Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
When her children were grown, she began to write. She showed her husband a
100-page effort. He "said it wasn't good," she told an interviewer, but "I just
kept at it. I wasn't a slave to his opinion."
</P>
<P>
When she criticized his work, he would yell. But she stood her ground. "He had
to be the best writer in the world," she said. "I didn't see it as a contest."
</P>
<P>
She wrote two novels, "Windchill Summer" (2000) and "Cheap Diamonds" (2007).
</P>
<P>
A severe test came after they had been together for 16 years and she learned
that he had been unfaithful. "But it's not so easy," she later said, "to leave
an entire life to go to - what?"
</P>
<P>
Even more important, she said, he asked her to forgive him, with such sincerity
"that I did."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the children and stepchildren, Mrs. Mailer is survived by her
mother.
</P>
<P>
It had been a wonderful life, living with her celebrated novelist husband, Mrs.
Mailer said this year. They had been together for more than 30 years. Yet as a
widow she could think of compensations for being on her own.
</P>
<P>
"Now," she told an interviewer for the Los Angeles Times, "I don't have to fight
for the TV clicker."

Cuba&amp;apos;s Jewish Hostage
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON POST-BLOOMBERG--12-07-10 0942ET
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
Raul Castro's attempt to win foreign favor and investment for Cuba's moribund
economy took a particularly cynical turn on Sunday, when the dictator celebrated
Hanukkah with Havana's tiny Jewish community. Broadcast on state television, the
event was designed to prove that the regime doesn't share the anti-Semitism of
allies such as Iran and Venezuela. There was just one problem: No mention was
made of Alan P. Gross, an American from Potomac, Md., who passed the holiday in
a Cuban military facility, where he has been imprisoned for a year without trial
because he tried to help Cuba's Jews.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Gross, a 61-year-old specialist in international development, traveled to
Cuba under a contract from the State Department's Agency for International
Development. His mission was to connect members of the Jewish community to the
Internet, using laptops and satellite equipment, so that they could contact
other Jewish communities and download information from sites such as Wikipedia.
Though that is normal activity in most of the world - and Mr. Gross declared his
garden-variety equipment to Cuban customs - he was arrested on Dec. 3, 2009.
</P>
<P>
Senior Cuban officials claimed that Mr. Gross, who is himself Jewish but speaks
little Spanish, was sent to Cuba as a spy. Yet a year later, not a single charge
has been brought against him - a violation of Cuba's laws. In that time, the
contractor's health has badly deteriorated. According to his wife, he has lost
90 pounds and developed back problems that have caused partial paralysis in one
leg. Several months ago, one of his daughters was diagnosed with breast cancer
and is undergoing chemotherapy. Because of the loss of his income, his wife has
been forced to move from their Potomac home to a small apartment in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Appeals by the State Department and congressional leaders for Mr. Gross' release
on humanitarian grounds - or at least the detailing of charges against him -
have fallen on deaf ears in Havana. Instead the regime appears to be intent on
forcing an exchange of Mr. Gross for one or more of five Cuban intelligence
agents who are serving federal prison terms after being tried and convicted on
espionage charges. This makes Mr. Gross not a prisoner but a hostage - one whose
continued detention is a flagrant violation of international law and human
decency.
</P>
<P>
To its credit, the Obama administration has put further improvement of relations
with Cuba on hold while pressing for Mr. Gross' release. A statement released
Friday said the State Department had "made it very clear to the Cuban government
that the continued detention of Alan Gross is a major impediment to advancing
the dialogue between our two countries." Raul Castro should know that
orchestrated media events like his Hanukkah celebration are no substitute for
reversing this wrong.

4 militants killed in clash in S. Philippines
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MANILA, June 21 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Government soldiers clashed with Al Qaeda-linked militants in the jungles of
southern Philippine island of Jolo early Sunday morning, leaving four militants
killed and two soldiers injured, an army official said.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Juancho Sabban, commander of the military's Joint Task Force Comet,
said the 100 soldiers initiated the fight at a village near Parang town, a
stronghold of the 340-member Abu Sayyaf group.
</P>
<P>
The militants, led by Albader Parad and Dr. Abu, are the ones holding an Italian
Red Cross employee they kidnapped five months ago.
</P>
<P>
Sabban said the clash lasted about one hour and the militants fled as 200 more
troopers came to reinforce.
</P>
<P>
Three members of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC) -- Swiss
Andreas Notter, Italian Eugenio Vagni and Filipina Mary Jean Lacaba -- were
kidnapped in Patikul town of Sulu province on Jan. 15 after the team conducted a
humanitarian mission there.
</P>
<P>
Lacaba was released by the bandits on April 2 while Notter escaped weeks later.
</P>
<P>
When asked if Vagni was with the encountered group, Sabban answered in the
negative, saying Vagni is in a separate area.

<TEXT>
<P>
Three people were killed and nine others injured when a man opened fired in a
Pennsylvania fitness center, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police said the 48-year-old man walked into a fitness center near Pittsburgh on
Tuesday night and fired up to 52 shots at a dance exercise class, killing two
women and wounding nine others before fatally shooting himself.
</P>
<P>
"He walked right into the room where the shootings occurred as if he knew
exactly where he was going," Allegheny County police Superintendent Charles
Moffatt said at a press conference Wednesday. "I think he went in with the idea
of doing what he did."
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the gunman, who was wearing workout gear, walked to the back of
the room, put down a bag before coming up with two guns and opening fire on the
class.
</P>
<P>
Moffatt confirmed that at least two guns were discovered at the crime scene and
a note was also found in the man's bag. Moffatt did not disclose the details of
the note.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said the gunman has been identified as George Sodini of
Carnegie, Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
According to messages posted on a website under his name, Sodini had hatred of
women and was tired of being rejected by them, media reports said.

Britain expresses concern over abductions of aid workers in S.
Philippines
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MANILA, Aug. 18 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The British government said Tuesday the spate of abductions of aid workers in
Mindanao, particularly in the provinces of Zamboanga, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, has
created "an atmosphere of fear and reluctance," jeopardizing the delivery of
services to the people in these conflict-torn areas.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the embassy on Tuesday, Chris Wright, head
of political section of the British Embassy, expressed concern that aid workers
have become targets of terrorism and kidnappings by lawless elements in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"Mindanao remains a priority area for development programs because of its
current socio-economic and political conditions. Most of the workers involved in
these programs are leaving the comfort of their own homes and spending time away
from their families to help people in areas of conflict where their safety is
compromised every day. Yet they continue because they know their mission is very
important," Wright said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 15, Abu Sayyaf gunmen snatched ICRC workers Eugenio Vagni of Italy,
Andreas Notter of Switzerland and Filipina Mary Jean Lacaba after inspecting a
jail water sanitary project in Jolo. All three have been released after months
in captivity.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, which is believed to have links with the Al- Qaeda terrorist
network, is in the U.S. government's foreign terrorist organization list. The
group has claimed responsibility for several terror attacks in the country and
is notorious for kidnapping foreigners in exchange for huge ransom.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the United Kingdom trained this week Philippine and foreign aid
workers assigned to places with the highest level of threat in the Philippines.
John Walker, one of the trainers, emphasized the need to help susceptible
individuals such as development workers to protect themselves from abduction.
</P>
<P>
Funded by the British government, the training is aimed at addressing their
security needs in areas vulnerable to kidnap- for- ransom activities.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this training, which has been provided by the same organization that
trains members of the U.K. government for deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan,
will help committed aid workers keep themselves safe while they work to improve
the lives of the people of Mindanao," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
Held in Zamboanga City, the training was a result of a series of roundtable
discussions with different institutions and government agencies to offer aid
workers tools to deal with potential dangers that come with their line of work
without compromising their commitment to assist others in need.

China steps up nationwide crackdown on gang crimes
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING, Nov. 10 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The series of high-profile organized crime trials in southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality have proved just the tip of the iceberg in a nationwide battle
against crime gangs.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, southwest China's Guizhou Province, published 10 e-mail addresses for
the public to report gang-related crimes on the website of its public security
department.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou police dealt with at least seven gang crime cases within 20 days in an
intensive crackdown last month.
</P>
<P>
Police in Hunan Province, in central China, was also reported to have broken up
three major criminal gangs in its Xiangxi prefecture this year.
</P>
<P>
Across Hunan, 73 officials were found to have shielded or been directly engaged
in gang-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
Other provinces such as Gansu and Anhui were also intensifying the fight against
organized crime gangs.
</P>
<P>
China's police launched a long-term campaign against criminal gangs in 2006. As
of September, more than 1,200 cases of gang crimes have been dealt with across
the country, with more than 13,000 criminal gangs broken up and at least 89,000
people arrested.
</P>
<P>
The revelations of police officials in collusion with criminals in Chongqing
Municipality that started in June have heightened coverage of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Mayor Wang Hongju revealed on Sunday that at least 200 local
judicatory officials had been found to be involved in organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
Wen Qiang, former deputy director of Chongqing's public security department, was
found to have shielded criminal gangs and committed other crimes while holding
his post.
</P>
<P>
Wen will be prosecuted later this month in connection with the offences of rape,
money laundering, disguising or concealing the proceeds of crime, illegally
holding firearms, offering loans at high interest, forging official and
corporate seals, introducing women to prostitution and taking bribes.
</P>
<P>
Wen's sister-in-law, organized crime boss Xie Caiping, was sentenced to 18 years
in prison after a first-instance trial last week.
</P>
<P>
Xie, labeled the "godmother of the underworld" in Chongqing, was convicted of
organizing and leading a criminal organization, running gambling dens, illegal
imprisonment, harboring people taking illegal narcotics and giving bribes to
officials.
</P>
<P>
Another 21 people in Xie's case, including officials who offered protection to
gang members, were given jail terms ranging from one to 13 years in sentences
handed down at the Chongqing No. 5 Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing's procuratorate has issued arrest warrants for more than 800 suspects
in the municipality's crackdown on gang-related crimes, and more than 320 people
have been prosecuted so far.
</P>
<P>
At least 52 local officials have been investigated or punished for shielding
criminal gangs in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yongkang, member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee Political Bureau, pledged in late October that the campaign
would continue until criminal gangs were eradicated.
</P>
<P>
Zhou urged a relentless investigation of any official providing a "protective
umbrella" for organized crime.

<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality said Friday they had
officially charged a former police officer with taking bribes and protecting
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Wen Qiang, former deputy director of Chongqing's public security department, was
also accused of rape and being unable to explain the sources of his assets,
according to a statement published on the website of the municipal
procuratorate, www.cqjcy.gov.cn.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said investigations showed Wen had abused his power by offering
benefits to others and accepted huge bribes personally or with his wife Zhou
Xiaoya when he served in a series of Communist Party of China and administrative
posts at the Public Security Bureau of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
He had also covered up or allowed organized crime led by notorious gangleaders,
including Xie Caiping, Wang Tianlun and Gong Gangmo, and received bribes from
them.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not reveal the amount of bribes or his unidentified assets.
</P>
<P>
Wen's wife and three other police officers involved in the case also faced
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Wen was among many high-ranking local officials prosecuted during a massive

director of Chongqing's public security department Peng Changjian, and former
vice general manager of the Development and Management Co. Ltd. of Chongqing's

Former judicial official stands trial in China gang crackdown
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CHONGQING, Feb. 2 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former top judicial official in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality stood
trial Tuesday on charges of protecting mafia-style gangs and other crimes, the
latest court hearing in the city's sweeping crackdown on gang crimes.
</P>
<P>
Wen Qiang, 55, former director of the Chongqing Municipal Judicial Bureau, was
also accused of taking bribes, rape and owning huge amounts of money and assets
he could not justify, heard the Chongqing Municipal No. 5 Intermediate People's
Court.
</P>

Prosecutors said Wen took bribes totaling more than 16 million yuan (2.4 million
U.S. dollars) personally or through his wife Zhou Xiaoya from 1996 to 2009 from
ring leaders, government officials, companies and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
To return favors to bribers, Wen, who had served as a senior police officer in
Chongqing for 16 years, gave protection to gangs, offered posts for officials,
and helped companies and businessmen obtain gains and evade police
investigations, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
Wen was also charged with raping a university student on several occasions in
2007 and 2008.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wen could not account for the source of more than 10 million yuan
in his personal assets.
</P>
<P>
Other defendants also brought to the court together with Wen Tuesday included
his wife Zhou Xiaoya and three senior former Chongqing policemen, Huang
Daiqiang, Zhao Liming and Chen Tao.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was accused of seeking gains for others and illegally taking money of 8.16
million yuan from them by taking the advantage of being the spouse of government
official.
</P>
<P>
The three former police officers face a series of charges including bribery and
protecting gangs.
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last four or five days.

1st Ld-Writethru: China vows to clean up judiciary after
conviction of supreme court  vice president
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's Chief Justice Wang Shengjun said Thursday that courts will take actions
on judicial corruption to prevent abuse of judicial power after a former vice
president of the supreme court was jailed for life two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court (SPC) will "strengthen capacity building and act as a
model for local courts," Wang, SPC president, told nearly 3,000 lawmakers at the
annual parliament session when delivering a work report.
</P>
<P>
The pledge came after Huang Songyou, former SPC vice president, was sentenced on
Jan. 19 to life imprisonment for taking bribes and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
Huang was convicted of taking more than 3.9 million yuan (about 574,000 U.S.
dollars) of bribes from 2005 to 2008.
</P>
<P>
Wang said nearly 800 court officials were punished for violating laws last year.
</P>
<P>
Courts at all levels should "learn a lesson from the case of Huang Songyou" to
find out rooted problems on the management of judges and supervision of power,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The SPC has appointed discipline supervisors in its 14 departments and more than
27,700 supervisors are watching over nearly 3,000 courts nationwide, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor-General Cao Jianming said in a separate report the same day that
prosecutors investigated more than 2,700 judiciary workers suspected of graft
and malpractice for personal gains last year.
</P>
<P>
Cao said the authority will "never relax its efforts" in crack down on judicial
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Judiciary staff will be punished if they are found "meddling and intervening
court cases, giving bribes to law enforcement personnel, beating or verbally
abusing petitioners and over- running timetables in enforcing court rulings,"
according to an SPC regulation earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Cao said in the report that efforts should be made to "resolutely punish corrupt
act in the judicial sector to purify the judicial team and safeguard integrity
and justice."
</P>
<P>

A plane has overshot the runway at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, the United
States on Friday, according to the NBC report.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the pilot of the corporate jet went "too long" on the landing
and the plane hit an "arrester bed," which crumbled under the weight of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear what caused the plane to go into the safety bed --
aerated cement blocks that are designed to fall apart under the weight of a
plane, stopping it from veering out of control at the end of runway.
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates
the airport, was quoted as saying that seven passengers and two pilots were
aboard the G-4 Gulfstream.

The incident occurred at about 1:45 p.m. local time Friday, she said.

Cuba continues investigation on jailed U.S. contractor

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cuban authorities have continued to investigate U.S. contractor Alan Gross,
arrested a year ago on espionage charges, Attorney General Dario Delgado said
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Delgado chaired the 10th International Criminal Sciences Meeting 2010  at the
Havana Convention Palace until Thursday, attended by 300 specialists from over
20 nations from Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The investigation is still in the same situation. Our investigation has not
completed yet. We are still working and when we finish, we will give an official
answer," Delgado said.
</P>
<P>
Gross was arrested on Dec. 3, 2009 at the Havana Airport, and was accused of
providing internet satellite communication equipment to the anti-Castro groups
based on the island.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has called for his release on humanitarian grounds, saying that Gross
was only providing an internet connection to the Cuban Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
The detainee's wife, Judy Gross, wrote to Cuban leader Raul Castro in August to
express regret for her husband's work in Cuba. The Cuban authorities have
allowed Gross' wife to visit him at least once at a military hospital in Havana
where he was detained.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Gross has criticized the White House for not doing enough and described her
husband as "a victim caught in the crossfire between the two foes of the old
Cold War."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department recently dismissed an alleged plan to exchange Gross
for one of the five Cubans imprisoned since 1998 in the United States under
espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
The case has been handled by officials of both countries when they met in Havana
and Washington on migration and other bilateral issues.
