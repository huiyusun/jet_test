Abstract
Background
Haptoglobin is a glycoprotein produced mainly by the liver and
secreted into the circulation. Haptoglobin, by virtue of its high
affinity for hemoglobin, protects the tissues against hemoglobin-
induced oxidative damage and allows heme iron recycling. Haptoglobin
synthesis is controlled by various effectors, however, little is known
concerning its regulation by iron. Haptoglobin regulation in C57BL/6
and 129sv mice fed on an iron-rich diet for 3 weeks was thus
undertaken.

Results
Iron induced a dramatic post-transcriptional decrease of liver and
serum haptoglobin in C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, no alteration of
haptoglobin expression was detected in 129sv mice. We assumed that the
oxidative stress induced by iron in C57BL/6 mice altered the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) environment, leading to the incorrect
folding of haptoglobin and its subsequent degradation. To test this
hypothesis, the levels of the RE chaperone GRP78 were measured. This
chaperone is known to assist protein folding in the RE during
pathophysiological conditions. Interestingly, we found that the mRNA
and protein levels of GRP78 were decreased in iron-fed C57BL/6 mice,
while they were unchanged in iron-fed 129sv mice. These results
suggest that the correct processing of haptoglobin (glycosylation,
disulfide linkage, folding, and assembly) might be sensitive to ER
stress and that, in the absence of GRP78-mediated assistance, Hp is
degraded.

Conclusion
Our data demonstrate that iron regulates haptoglobin synthesis in
C57BL/6 mice and suggest a possible link with iron-induced ER stress.
