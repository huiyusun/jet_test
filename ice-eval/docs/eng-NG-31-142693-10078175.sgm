Family files claim against CPS for toddler's death

Tamekca Walker, 34, was arraigned Friday in Sacramento County Superior
Court on charges of felony assault resulting in the death of a child and
the murder of Tamaihia Lynae Moore.

Walker did not enter a plea.

Tamaihia, who was placed in Walker's south Sacramento home last month,
died on Monday. The cause of her death has not been determined.

But outside of the courtroom, Debra Oliver, the child's grandmother,
accused the county's Child Protective Services of being negligent in
Tamaihia's care and culpable in her death.

The toddler's family filed a wrongful death claim Friday against
Sacramento County as a precursor to a lawsuit.

&quot;They didn't do their job,&quot; Oliver said, as others close to the family
fought back tears. &quot;CPS can't say they're not at fault.&quot;

CURRENTLY CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES VIOLATES MORE CIVIL RIGHTS ON A
DAILY BASIS THEN ALL OTHER AGENCIES COMBINED INCLUDING THE NSA / CIA
WIRETAPPING PROGRAM....

CPS Does not protect children...
It is sickening how many children are subject to abuse, neglect and even
killed at the hands of Child Protective Services.

every parent should read this .pdf from
connecticut dcf watch...

http://www.connecticutdcfwatch.com

Number of Cases per 100,000 children in the US
These numbers come from The National Center on
Child Abuse and Neglect in Washington. (NCCAN)
Recent numbers have increased significantly for CPS

*Perpetrators of Maltreatment*

Physical Abuse CPS 160, Parents 59
Sexual Abuse CPS 112, Parents 13
Neglect CPS 410, Parents 241
Medical Neglect CPS 14 Parents 12
Fatalities CPS 6.4, Parents 1.5

Imagine that, 6.4 children die at the hands of the very agencies that
are supposed to protect them and only 1.5 at the hands of parents per
100,000 children. CPS perpetrates more abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse
and kills more children then parents in the United States. If the
citizens of this country hold CPS to the same standards that they hold
parents too. No judge should ever put another child in the hands of ANY
government agency because CPS nationwide is guilty of more harm and
death than any human being combined. CPS nationwide is guilty of more
human rights violations and deaths of children then the homes from which
they were removed. When are the judges going to wake up and see that
they are sending children to their death and a life of abuse when
children are removed from safe homes based on the mere opinion of a
bunch of social workers.

CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES, HAPPILY DESTROYING THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT
FAMILIES YEARLY NATIONWIDE AND COMING TO YOU'RE HOME SOON...

BE SURE TO FIND OUT WHERE YOUR CANDIDATES STANDS ON THE ISSUE OF
REFORMING OR ABOLISHING CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES (&quot;MAKE YOUR CANDIDATES
TAKE A STAND ON THIS ISSUE.&quot;) THEN REMEMBER TO VOTE ACCORDINGLY IF THEY
ARE &quot;FAMILY UNFRIENDLY&quot; IN THE NEXT ELECTION...
