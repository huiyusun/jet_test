<HL>    Clinton's Bumpy Start Slows Business
@  ----
@  A Wall Street Journal News Roundup </HL>
<DD> 06/18/93 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1 </SO>
<TXT>
<p>
   Many leaders of U.S. companies, large and small, are increasingly
disillusioned with the Clinton administration, saying uncertainties
about government policies are hindering business decisions.
</p>
<p>
   Some top executives who didn't like Bill Clinton in the first
place now view him as more indecisive than ever. And even former
supporters are expressing frustration. One complaint: It's politics
as usual, not business as usual.
</p>
<p>
   Despite all the criticism, the president has chalked up some
victories, leading some to hope that he is on the verge of turning
things around.
</p>
<p>
   In Congress, for instance, Mr. Clinton's deficit-reduction tax
plan, while full of compromises and scalings back, and his
legislation to reform campaign finance, also watered down, are
moving toward passage. And, of course, some captains of industry who
backed him in the campaign are either still positive or at least
hopeful.
</p>
<p>
   But most executives interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters
for this article give the president thumbs down for his performance
so far. They say his seeming unwillingness or inability to act on
major issues affecting the economy has hampered business planning. A
particular problem cited by many executives is the president's
failure to make some key appointments, leaving companies unable to
get responses to their questions or unsure of the direction
regulatory policy will take.
</p>
<p>
   "I think everyone is discouraged with what is going on in
Washington," says Kenneth Murphy, chairman, president and chief
executive officer of First Abilene Bankshares Inc., a small West
Texas bank-holding company. He adds: "It's politics as usual."
</p>
<p>
   While uncertainty over White House leadership and its impact on
the economy hasn't yet triggered any hard decisions at Hauser
Chemical Research Inc., the small Boulder, Colo., company is keeping
a close eye on a $7 million to $10 million manufacturing-plant
expansion. Although current plans are to complete the project, "I'd
say we are looking at it very closely," says CEO Dean P. Stull.
"We're probably a little more cautious about those decisions than we
would have been at the beginning of the presidency."
</p>
<p>
   Craig R. Benson, chairman of Cabletron Systems Inc., says he is a
Republican who didn't vote for Mr. Clinton and now views him as more
indecisive than before the election. "There's been an awful lot of
jockeying back and forth on issues," he says, "and that causes a lot
of wasted energy on our part." For example, says Mr. Benson, the
Rochester, N.H., maker of computer-networking products is trying to
decide about expanding or contracting its foreign factories, based
partly on U.S. tax policy. But now the administration is considering
three different versions of new tax rules on the profits of such
facilities. Mr. Benson says, "It's driving me nuts" trying to make a
decision while the administration mulls the variations.
</p>
<p>
   The Clinton administration has shown "frightening
indecisiveness," says Morton E. David, chairman and CEO of Franklin
Electronic Publishers Inc., which makes hand-held electronic books.
The executive thought Mr. Clinton had a "mastery of politics" when
he was elected, but now "I'm not sure of the president's ability as
a politician." Mr. David expects the uncertainty created by the
administration to hurt retail performance overall, even through the
fall, Franklin's biggest season. "We've been reducing our plans for
the number of products to build for sale in the Christmas season."
</p>
<p>
   Presidential priorities concern some business leaders. Mitchell
E. Kertzman, CEO of Powersoft Corp., a Burlington, Mass., software
maker, and former president of the American Electronics Association,
says: "I'm still a supporter, but I would say I'm a frustrated
supporter" of the president. Mr. Kertzman says Mr. Clinton expended
too much political capital in the first weeks of his presidency by
focusing too much on social issues -- on which, Mr. Kertzman
generally supports the Clinton policies -- and not enough on pushing
his economic plan through Congress. "Now it's going to be very hard
to get anything done," he says.
</p>
<p>
   Also concerned about priorities is Charles LaMantia, president
and chief executive of Arthur D. Little Inc., a closely held
management-consulting company in Cambridge, Mass. He is "really
quite concerned" that the Clinton administration won't be able to
accomplish any of its goals. The president's main problem, Mr.
LaMantia adds, is that "he let peripheral issues or ones of little
importance define him and weaken his leadership position." Gays in
the military, for example. And "the haircut incident was a
leadership catastrophe."
</p>
<p>
   Health-care reform is among the major concerns. In Maywood, N.J.,
Judith Fitzpatrick-Davis, president of Serex Inc., a small maker of
medical-test kits, says she regrets voting for Mr. Clinton. "In
agony, I voted for him at the last moment" in the hope that he would
bring creative solutions to the health-care crisis and other
problems. She adds that Mr. Clinton now appears incapable of making
"the hard choices" necessary.
</p>
<p>
   William W. George, president and CEO of Medtronic Inc., a
Minneapolis medicaldevice company, says of Mr. Clinton: I voted for
him, and I did it on the thought that we needed a change. But I
don't think I could vote for him now." Mr. George says he is no
longer sure where the president stands on several issues, and he has
been disappointed by the "secretive" nature of the Hillary Rodham
Clinton health-care panel's deliberations. He also decries the
administration's tough remarks about medical companies, saying "the
stock price of everything in medicine has been hit because of the
frontal assault."
</p>
<p>
   The travel and tourism industry also has been hurt badly by the
Clinton administration, asserts Robert C. Hazard Jr., chairman and
chief executive of the Choice Hotels International unit of Manor
Care Inc., Silver Spring, Md. Mr. Hazard says proposed taxes and
regulations threaten to strangle the industry. Key Posts Several
executives cited the president's failure to make important
appointments. "The fact that so many key jobs remain vacant is a
problem" says Harold "Red" Poling, chairman and CEO of Ford Motor
Co. "For example, the two key subcabinet posts relating to our
industry National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
administrator and Environmental Protection Agency assistant
administrator for air and radiation remain unfilled at a time when
major policies are under discussion."
</p>
<p>
   MCI's Mr. Roberts says, "We're sitting here in mid-June and the
president has not yet selected a head of the Federal Communications
Commission." When agencies aren't supervised, he says, "government
stops."
</p>
<p>
   To be sure, the president has his supporters. Among them is Marc
Nathanson, chairman and CEO of Falcon Cable Systems Co., a Los
Angeles-based cable-television company. "The administration's start
has been bumpy," he concedes. "But we need to give Clinton a break,
and I believe he will be resilient. He and his staff need to adjust
to the insider's games and the special-interest groups in Washington
as well as a very cynical press corps. I believe he will do it and
will go down in history as a great president."
</p>
<p>
   In any case, the clouds of criticism have a few silver linings.
</p>
<p>
   That's almost literally true for G. Michael Boswell, chairman and
CEO of Sunshine Mining Co., a Dallas-based integrated
precious-metals company. While he talks of a Clinton "debacle," he
adds: "His actions have actually helped our industry, though I don't
think that was the administration's intentions. Precious-metal
prices have strengthened in recent months, and if that continues
then we would anticipate some hiring."
</p>
<p>
   And Mr. LaMantia says Arthur D. Little "thrives on issues and
problems, so we're doing quite well."

<HL>    Business Brief:
@  Northern Telecom Expects to Report
@  Loss for Second Quarter on Weak Sales </HL>

<TXT>
<p>
   Northern Telecom Ltd. said it will report a loss for
the second quarter because of lower-than-expected sales and pricing
pressures on its public switching systems.
</p>
<p>
   The late Friday announcement, following a board meeting by the
supplier of digital telecommunications switching systems, follows a
27% drop in first-quarter net income. That quarter's disappointing
results were because of lower margins and increased research and
development and other expenses, which weren't offset by expected
revenue growth.
</p>
<p>
   "Revenues in North America and Europe, with the exception of a
few sectors, are showing slower growth than expected," Jean C.
Monty, president and chief executive, said.
</p>
<p>
   The announcement came after the stock market closed; Northern
Telecom's shares rose 37.5 cents to $37 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
</p>
<p>
   Separately, the company said it named O. Bradford Butler, former
chairman of Procter & Gamble Co., as chairman of Northern Telecom.
Mr. Butler, 69 years old, succeeds Paul Stern, who resigned as
chairman and a director.
</p>
<p>
   Dr. Stern, 54, resigned as chief executive March 1 to accept an
appointment as a visiting executive professor at the Wharton School
of the University of Pennsylvania. He became nonexecutive chairman,
and Mr. Monty was named chief executive officer. Dr. Stern's
resignation Friday as chairman "is part of an orderly transition," a
spokesman said.
</p>
<p>
   In the 1992 second quarter, Northern Telecom's net income plunged
by a third to $72.3 million, or 28 cents a share, on lower revenue
because of the sale of some businesses by its British unit and a
slowdown of equipment orders in the U.S. and Europe. Northern
Telecom is majority owned by Canada's BCE Inc.
</p>
<p>
   Weaker performance in the first half of 1993 and the outlook for
the rest of the year would result in full-year earnings being
"significantly" below 1992's results, Mr. Monty said. This reverses
a forecast by Dr. Stern, who said in January that "we still expect
to have a record year in 1993."
</p>
<p>
   The projected loss for the second quarter is mainly a reflection
of recessionary pressures in the U.S. and abroad, the spokesman
said.

@  Japan Economy Posts Quarterly Gain,
@  But Some See Reversal in Current Period
@  ----
@  By John Bussey
@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<DD> 06/21/93 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A8 </SO>
<DATELINE> TOKYO </DATELINE>
<TXT>
<p>
   Japan got some good economic news: The nation's gross
national product in the January through March quarter expanded at a
2.3% inflation-adjusted annualized rate, or 0.6% from the previous
quarter.
</p>
<p>
   That is the best performance in quite some time. Indeed, gross
domestic product, which excludes net inflows of income from
overseas, turned positive for the first time in four quarters,
expanding at an annualized rate of 2.7%, or 0.7% from the previous
quarter.
</p>
<p>
   But economists here say the economy may be headed back down in
the current quarter. They say certain unusual factors skewed the
January to March quarter's numbers, and that the period's
performance was also boosted by the government lowering its GNP
statistics for the quarter ended Dec. 31. The stronger yen, which
hurts exports, and Japan's current political turmoil are also
expected to depress the economy this summer. Some economists here
are using the term "double-dip" to describe the spring's
performance.
</p>
<p>
   "The economy remains in a bumping-along-the-bottom phase," says
Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.
"We still aren't seeing a sustained recovery. We think we have a
pretty rough summer before us."
</p>
<p>
   That said, there were some definite bright spots in the January
to March period. Personal consumption was up, as was public
investment. But the former was induced partly by desperate
manufacturers and merchants, who sought to boost results before the
March 31 closing of the fiscal year by slashing prices. Indeed, auto
sales bounced up 1.7% in March -- the first gain in nine months.
Merchants warned at the time that their efforts might have "robbed"
sales from April. And they were right: Auto sales in April sank 11%.
Other indicators, including those for capital spending, have
continued to slump in recent months.
</p>
<p>
   Public investment was up 6.5% from the previous quarter, a
reflection of the government's emergency public-spending package
passed last year. Clearly, the stimulus program is boosting the
economy, and shows the enduring strength of this nation: Unlike the
U.S., which is hobbled by its national debt, Japan has the ability
to spend its way out of recession.
</p>
<p>
   "Basically, the economy moved only because you had this strong
government spending," says Kenneth S. Courtis, economist at Deutsche
Bank AG.
</p>
<p>
   Notably, though, public investment accounts for only 7% of GNP,
compared with the consumer's share of roughly 57%. "Public
investment is up 15.5% year on year, which is pretty strong stuff,"
says Mr. Barker. "But the crucial thing is, you've got to have the
participation of the consumer" to sustain any recovery.
</p>
<p>
   Japanese officials are also bracing for the impact of the strong
yen. Although the recent political problems have brought the
Japanese currency down some, it is still roughly 10% higher against
the dollar compared with late February. The yen likely had little
effect on the January to March quarter, largely because
exchange-rate-induced price fluctuations aren't passed through the
pipeline to the consumer quite so quickly. But the effect will
probably begin to be felt this summer, and if exports are crimped,
Japan's economy could feel greater pain.
</p>
<p>
   Off-setting that pain, however, is an additional emergency
public-spending package that is coming on line. But the fall of the
Japanese government Friday, after a no-confidence vote passed the
Diet, injects additional uncertainty into the equation. Consumers
and businesses alike may choose to hunker down and curtail spending
until the political smoke clears.

<p>
   Software Toolworks Inc. reported an unexpected
net loss of $451,000, or two cents a share, for its fourth quarter,
ended March 31, and named a new chief executive officer.
</p>
<p>
   The quarterly results were well below some analysts' estimates,
which had put net income in the quarter in the range of seven cents
a share for the maker of educational, entertainment and multimedia
software.
</p>
<p>
   Investors demonstrated their disappointment by driving Software
Toolworks' stock down $1.125, or 10%, to $9.875, in late
over-the-counter trading.
</p>
<p>
   In the year-earlier quarter, the company had a net loss of $16
million, or 63 cents a share.
</p>
<p>
   Revenue for the latest quarter rose 20%, to $27.8 million from
$23.1 million a year ago.
</p>
<p>
   Ben Z. Rose, an analyst with Hancock Institution Equity Services
Inc., said the company was hurt in the quarter by its continued
dependence on some lower-profit margin products for a substantial
portion of sales, as well as more conservative provisions for
returned products, among other things.
</p>
<p>
   For the full fiscal year, net income was $3.5 million, or 12
cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $14.5 million,
or 59 cents a share. Revenue for the full year rose about 17% to
$119.6 million from $102.6 million.
</p>
<p>
   The company also said Bob Lloyd, president and chief operating
officer, was named to the additional post of chief executive. He
succeeds Les Crane, founder of the company, who retains his position
as chairman.
</p>
<p>
   The company said Mr. Lloyd's promotion recognizes his role in
helping turn around Software Toolworks results. Mr. Crane said that
the company has "moved beyond the entrepreneurial stage" and that
Mr. Lloyd is well-equipped to chart the company's further expansion.

@  Benefiting From Operating Experience,
@  More Finance Chiefs Become Strategists
@  ----
@  By Leslie Scism
@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<DD> 06/08/93 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1 </SO>
<TXT>
<p>
   Hiking over a hillside in Vail, Colo., Alex Mandl, point man for
American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s push into cellular phones,
wrestled with a make-or-break chance to revive a troubled
negotiation.
</p>
<p>
   "Let's do it," Mr. Mandl said to his companion, recommending a
creative, complicated -- and potentially very costly -- scheme to
buy part of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.
</p>
<p>
   For many top executives, embracing a set of uncertainties and
plunging into a risky venture is nothing more than earning a day's
pay. But what made Mr. Mandl's decision unusual was that he is
AT&T's chief financial officer, one of the oft-maligned bean
counters traditionally cast in supporting roles during big deals.
</p>
<p>
   "That's the kind of decision that an old-style CFO would have
wrung his hands over," recalls McCaw Vice Chairman Wayne Perry, who
was Mr. Mandl's companion in Vail's woods.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Mandl is one of a growing number of chief financial officers
expanding the definition of the top financial job well beyond its
traditional numbers-crunching origin. A few finance chiefs achieved
high-profile status as fund-raising whizzes during the go-go '80s.
Then when the recession forced many companies to consider
downsizing, the intimate knowledge chief financial officers had of
every facet of operations broadened their influence.
</p>
<p>
   Now, the chief financial officer as strategic planner is
emerging. The redefined role, headhunters and management consultants
say, is born of the sluggish economic recovery. In an era of
heightened competition and hard-to-make-stick price increases, the
financial fine points of any new strategy are more crucial than ever
before. Many finance chiefs can provide that data, as well as savvy
judgment about products, marketing and other areas, the experts say.
</p>
<p>
   "CEOs have decided that constant restructuring has to take place,
and the key place where it comes together is finance," says Stephen
Scroggins, managing director of Russell Reynolds Associates, a
headhunting firm.
</p>
<p>
   At Russell Reynolds, nearly all CEOs now seeking finance chiefs
want someone with "sound business judgment . . . more than just a
CFO." And in a recent survey by headhunters Korn/Ferry
International, Fortune 100 chief financial officers almost
unanimously described themselves as "more of a partner with the CEO"
than they used to be.
</p>
<p>
   It is too soon to tell whether the new role means that more
finance chiefs are destined for the top job, headhunters say. A few
companies, like General Electric Co., have long given finance people
strategic roles. The result: "GE's {finance} people are prime
candidates for CEO positions in almost any other business," says
Glenn Van Doren, president of the Association of Executive Search
Consultants, a trade group.
</p>
<p>
   The breadth of the revolution also is uncertain. "This is a
large-company phenomenon," says Windle Priem, Korn/Ferry managing
director. He cites shareholder activism at big industrial companies
like Eastman Kodak Co. and International Business Machines Corp.
that forces CEOs to maximize earnings. "The logical place this falls
is the shoulders of the CFO," Mr. Priem says. But where
institutional investors aren't pushing for change, chief executive
officers tend to use chief financial officers mostly for backseat
number-crunching chores.
</p>
<p>
   And some finance chiefs may overestimate the degree to which
their role has changed, concludes a study of 180 medium to large
companies funded by the Financial Executives Research Board.
</p>
<p>
   The study compares responses of financial and nonfinancial
managers to questions about the changing role of finance chiefs. The
questions address the degree to which the companies' finance units
have moved from the role of "corporate policeman" to that of
"business advocate," in which financial managers offer strategy to
operating units. In general, when financial managers credit
themselves for change, nonfinancial managers in the same company
agree less than 15% of the time, co-author Stephen Jablonsky says.
</p>
<p>
   Traditionally, finance chiefs have spent 90% of their time
overseeing receivables and payables, closing accounting books,
preparing annual reports, meeting regulatory requirements,
budgeting, raising routine funds and issuing reports that measure
actual performance against projections, says Robert Howell, a New
York University professor. Projects like a stock offering or a
merger claimed remaining time.
</p>
<p>
   Finance chiefs breaking the mold tend to have a common element:
operating experience. That makes them far more able "to do the tough
things," Mr. Priem says. Most finance chiefs have traditionally come
up through a "silo" -- the narrow path from accountant to manager to
assistant controller to controller to chief financial officer. "The
old knock on a CFO was: You've never run anything," Mr. Priem says.
(Whatever their backgrounds, many finance chiefs in recent months
have been earning their stripes by paring down their own finance
operations.)
</p>
<p>
   One of numerous outsiders hired to shake up AT&T by CEO Robert
Allen, Alex Mandl arrived last year from Sea-Land Services Inc.,
where he had been CEO. In three years, Mr. Mandl had made the
money-losing CSX Corp. unit profitable by increasing revenue,
decentralizing operations and negotiating international deals.
</p>
<p>
   "Running a significant company gives you a very different
perspective on how the financial function should be performed," says
Mr. Mandl, whose earlier career at CSX and Boise-Cascade was a blend
of finance and operations. Mr. Mandl, who also runs AT&T Capital
Corp. and serves on AT&T's five-person operating committee, focuses
"on what's driving the numbers," not the numbers themselves.
</p>
<p>
   Another modern chief financial officer is Jerome York, the former
Chrysler Corp. finance chief who last month took IBM's top finance
post. A West Point and Massachusetts Institute of Technology
graduate, he began his automotive career as a General Motors Corp.
engineer. He added an M.B.A. and moved into planning at Ford Motor
Co. A mix of operating and finance jobs followed.
</p>
<p>
   As Chrysler finance chief since 1990, he helped cut $3 billion in
costs and sold more than $3 billion of non-core assets. "You just
can't mindlessly take across-the-board costs out," Mr. York says.
"You have to understand where the efficiency levers are."
</p>
<p>
   Learning IBM's "levers" is his challenge. With no background in
computers, he plans extensive visits to factories, dealers,
suppliers and customers.
</p>
<p>
   In Plano, Texas, Frito-Lay Inc. Finance Chief Michael D. White
figures he spends more than half his time on such visits to identify
fast-growing customers of the PepsiCo Inc. unit and ways to serve
them more cheaply. One night recently found him in Cincinnati dining
with merchandising people from customer Kroger Co. "In the past, the
CFO's biggest role was to finance growth, but growth used to be
easier," Mr. White says. "It's a lot more competitive out there
now."
</p>
<p>
   At UNUM Corp., a specialty insurance company, the shift to
"strategic partner" was begun 15 months ago when unanticipated
problems in several business segments surfaced, Finance Chief Rodney
Hook says. "Our CEO has told us that he's not interested in post
mortems," Mr. Hook says. "We're now looking for leading indicators,
instead of being scorekeeper."
</p>
<p>
   At AT&T, CEO Robert Allen handed Mr. Mandl the McCaw negotiating
role as part of a broader assignment to find the company's place in
wireless technology. Mr. Mandl has relished the deal makingeven the
rough spot in Vail.
</p>
<p>
   The issue last year as he hiked: McCaw's worry that it "would be
burned" for not going to the capital markets to raise money at then
favorable rates, McCaw's Mr. Perry recalls. The protracted
negotiations effectively precluded McCaw from seeking funds, because
it would have to reveal the talks.
</p>
<p>
   So McCaw proposed that AT&T agree to buy $400 million of McCaw
stock based on that day's closing price even if AT&T and McCaw
couldn't reach terms on a deal that would ultimately give AT&T
control. Mr. Mandl, whose agreement to the "put" option subsequently
was supported by AT&T's board of directors, is generally credited
with structuring the tentative $3.82 billion deal that AT&T and
McCaw announced last November. He is now hammering out operating
details.

   Ukraine's Parliament Friday rejected Prime Minister
Leonid Kuchma's resignation, which he announced Thursday, and
delayed a decision on a proposal by President Leonid Kravchuk that
he become head of the government.
</p>
<p>
   Currently, the president is head of the executive branch and the
prime minister is head of government.
</p>
<p>
   Some lawmakers and government officials worry that Ukraine's
already staggering economy is headed for collapse because no one
will be in charge of the reform process.
</p>
<p>
   Friends of Mr. Kuchma say it is possible that even though
Parliament didn't accept his resignation, the prime minister will
quit his post anyway.

<HL>    REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial):
@  Europe Gets the Message </HL>
<DD> 05/17/93 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16 </SO>
<IN> COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (CMT), TELEPHONE SYSTEMS (TLS) </IN>
<TXT>
<p>
   Over a century ago, the chief engineer at the British Post Office
was brought to testify before a parliamentary commission on whether
an American invention called the telephone deserved any notice. As
told by scientist and author Arthur C. Clarke, the engineer was
asked whether Alexander Bell's invention "will be of any use in
Great Britain." He replied, "No, sir. The Americans have need of the
telephone, but we do not. We have plenty of messenger boys."
</p>
<p>
   Governments have always had a weird relationship with technology.
They are typically slow to recognize the implications of
technological advances and quick to assert control over them once
they do. But the fact that Britain has scrapped its sleepy state
telecommunications system for one of the most open and progressive
private systems in Europe is cause for optimism. If the trend
continues, the world's chances greatly improve of efficiently
integrating its commerce and finances.
</p>
<p>
   Britain's fellow EC members seem to be slowly getting the
message: EC telecommunications ministers emerged from their meeting
in Brussels last week affirming their commitment to ending state
monopolies and opening Europe's $134 billion telecommunications
services industry to competition. Even France, Belgium and Spain,
which so vociferously opposed liberalizations a couple of years
back, are cautiously on board.
</p>
<p>
   This is consensus born of sheer necessity. The industry is
pervaded by monopolies and price distortions: A call from Germany to
Britain can cost up to 30% more than a call from Britain to Germany,
national rates vary widely from country to country and rates in
Europe as a whole dwarf U.S. telephone charges for the same
distances. The industry badly needs the kind of investment and
management only the private sector can bring it. A report ordered by
the European Commission last year concluded that ending cross-border
monopolies and introducing other liberalizations would lead to a
tripling of Europe's telecom services market in two decades.
</p>
<p>
   Currently, Britain is the only EC country with a truly
liberalized telecom industry. Denmark is to open its market next
year and Italy is inching toward cutting its own sky-high phone
rates. If Germany goes through with its plan to sell a 49% stake in
the state phone monopoly, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, it should
provide a push for other European governments to do the same.
</p>
<p>
   Given the benefits, 1998 seems like a particularly unambitious
deadline. At base, most European governments still retain an
instinct for nurturing industry and a dislike for foreign (that is,
American and Japanese) competition. To this end, they pointlessly
retain differing technical standards.
</p>
<p>
   Europe has clearly made strides toward overcoming the sort of
blinkered protectionism that sacrifices technological advances,
business growth and consumer interest. But it needs to go much
further. If Europe really wants to be competitive in television and
other services, it can start by letting the competition in.
</p>
<p>
   Arthur C. Clarke wrote: "As the century that saw the birth of
both electronics and optonics draws to a close, it would seem that
virtually everything we would wish to do in the field of
telecommunications is now technically possible. The only limitations
are financial, legal and political."

@  Bulgaria's Once-Feared Strongman
@  Looks Back on Reign With Bitterness

<DATELINE> SOFIA, Bulgaria </DATELINE>
<TXT>
<p>
   The elderly man who opens the wooden door of
the hillside villa is stooped and shriveled. Followed by a cocker
spaniel, he shuffles onto the balcony in his slippers to admire the
view.
</p>
<p>
   It's a bucolic scene in the gathering dusk -- except for two grim
police guards in black leather jackets hovering nearby who disturb
the musings of the former Communist dictator.
</p>
<p>
   "You might have heard of a man named Todor Zhivkov who was once
an important head of state," the man says, speaking of himself in
the third person. "Now, Zhivkov is accused by his enemies and
political opponents of all sorts of earthly sins," he continues.
"What more do you want to know? I can't tell you much because my
mouth and hands are tied."
</p>
<p>
   It is hard to imagine that this frail figure was once Eastern
Europe's longest-serving and, some say, most feared Communist
leader. For 35 years, until he was toppled in 1989 by reformers who
engineered a Communist Party palace coup, Mr. Zhivkov and his
lackeys, backed by the secret police and Moscow, ruled Bulgaria.
They presided over its economic decline into a squalid Balkan
backwater.
</p>
<p>
   Today, Mr. Zhivkov, 81 years old, is under house arrest after
being found guilty of embezzlement, misappropriating state funds and
handing out apartments, holiday homes and cars to cronies for free,
or rock-bottom prices.
</p>
<p>
   He lives at his granddaughter's swanky -- by Bulgarian standards
-- suburban retreat pending appeal. While legal authorities haggle
over his sentence of seven years in prison and a $1 million fine,
Mr. Zhivkov, along with many ordinary Bulgarians, is doing some
soul-searching about socialism's legacy.
</p>
<p>
   It isn't easy to unravel. Communism's history is still cloaked in
secrecy. Disinformation is rife. How can anyone, for example, prove
that Mr. Zhivkov sucked the state coffers dry when official
documents show he earned only $80 a month as Bulgaria's head of
state and party general secretary. Not only is he innocent of
charges of having lived lavishly at the people's expense, he
grumbles, but he is also a virtual pauper.
</p>
<p>
   "Look at me -- I don't have anything," he complains, his voice
begging for sympathy. "I wear old clothes and live on a pension of
$44 a month. That's not even enough to pay for my medicine. People
say I've stashed away assets in Switzerland, and in Canada, but I
don't have one dollar, not one "lev" the Bulgarian currency. I don't
even have a bicycle."
</p>
<p>
   By all accounts, Mr. Zhivkov and his friends lived very well
while most Bulgarians barely scraped by. Seven of his estimated 30
state residences -- complete with gardens and helicopter landing
pads, and outfitted with saunas and heated indoor swimming pools --
were easily converted into tourist hotels.
</p>
<p>
   "Don't even try to compare how the Zhivkov clan and we lived,"
says Nedyalka Sandalska, vice president of the state tourist board
that claimed the properties.
</p>
<p>
   When Mr. Zhivkov fell, Bulgarians faced empty shops and an
economic crisis, but newspapers reported the existence of 1,500
"Zhivkovite" dollar millionaires.
</p>
<p>
   For decades, he governed with an iron fist, ruthlessly stamping
out all opposition whether at home or abroad: The exiled dissident
writer Georgi Markov was murdered by Bulgarian secret service agents
who jabbed him in the leg with a poisoned umbrella on a busy London
street.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Zhivkov denies all this ever happened. "We did have a police
force within the Interior Ministry, but compared to the CIA or KGB
this was just a drop in the bucket," he explains, pouring coffee
with trembling hands and passing around a plate of cookies.
</p>
<p>
   Looking back on his years in power, Mr. Zhivkov now takes credit
for being the first of the East bloc rulers to see the futility of
the system they created. After extensive travels to the West, he
argues, he realized that the apparatus of Soviet-style state
communism was doomed.
</p>
<p>
   "I was impressed with the Japanese miracle," he says. "You would
have to be a born idiot not to have realized that we the socialist
countries were being left far behind."
</p>
<p>
   Historians debate the merits of his claim. Rumor has it that he
did approach Leonid Brezhnev with such ideas, but that the Soviet
leader, now dead, simply told him to "shut up." Mr. Zhivkov says
that at first, Mikhail Gorbachev wouldn't listen either. "I knew
that if I continued, it would mean my political death," he alleges.
It was only in 1987, however, when winds of change were already
blowing, that Mr. Zhivkov won Bulgarian Politburo approval for a
plan to loosen Communist Party control and introduce market reforms.
</p>
<p>
   "I've always worked for the good of the country and to build up
society," he insists, his voice rising as he leans forward in his
chair and slices the air with his hand. "The Bulgarian people still
respect me for this. They write me letters saying how good life was
under Zhivkov and the Zhivkovists. My popularity rating is going up
and the current government's is falling."
</p>
<p>
   Not with everyone. Mr. Zhivkov faces possible charges of setting
up concentration camps from 1959 to 1962, diverting money to a
secret Soviet slush fund aiding terrorist groups, and instigating an
infamous campaign to forcefully assimilate Bulgaria's large ethnic
Turkish minority. Then there was the attempted assassination of Pope
John Paul II and suspected Bulgarian government complicity in the
murky conspiracy.
</p>
<p>
   He won't comment on these accusations. At his trial, he refused
responsibility for anything, saying that all state decisions were
taken collectively and that it is illegal to put a chief executive
on trial.
</p>
<p>
   Despite hard times under his reign, Bulgarians harbor mixed
feelings about Mr. Zhivkov's trial and house arrest. They danced in
the streets when he was overthrown; today, the mood has turned
indifferent. "At first, people wanted his head," says a local
journalist. "Now, everyone has problems just to survive. They don't
care about the past."
</p>
<p>
   Businessman Ludmil Lalov has a more cynical view: "The people in
power today are worse than Zhivkov-they're all Zhivkovs," he
asserts, referring to a wave of recent corruption scandals.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Zhivkov peers out the window through his thick glasses. "It's
quite an isolated life here," he says wistfully, folding his hands
around his belly. "I don't see many people anymore -- just my
granddaughter and the maid. I don't really understand it, but nobody
comes around to ask my advice about anything."

<p>
   Members of the Midwest Stock Exchange, the nation's
second biggest stock market in terms of value of shares traded,
voted to change the name of their institution to the Chicago Stock
Exchange.
</p>
<p>
   The exchange, founded in 1882, was originally known as the
Chicago Stock Exchange. Its name was changed to the Midwest Stock
Exchange in 1949, after it acquired stock exchanges in Cleveland,
St. Louis and Minneapolis.
</p>
<p>
   Members of the exchange chose to restore the original name
because "our institution is rich in tradition, and we're proud of
our Chicago heritage," said Homer J. Livingston Jr., president and
chief executive officer of the exchange. "We operate in a very
competitive environment and want to build the identity of our
exchange locally, nationally and internationally," he said.
</p>

   The name change will be effective in July.

<p>
   U.K. shipping, property and engineering conglomerate
Trafalgar House PLC posted a loss for the fiscal first half ended
March 31 and slashed its dividend 72%. But the company's stock rose
as it appointed a prominent Hong Kong businessman as its new
chairman.
</p>
<p>
   The British company, whose interests include the Cunard cruise
lines and the Ritz hotel of London, said Simon Keswick, the head of
Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd. will take over as chairman May 26.
Hongkong Land holds 25.1% of Trafalgar, acquired after a hostile
raid against Trafalgar in October. Hongkong Land is itself
controlled by Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., a giant Hong Kong
conglomerate.
</p>
<p>
   Hongkong Land has been shaking up Trafalgar management since
acquiring its stake.
</p>
<p>
   In trading on the London exchange, Trafalgar shares rose three
pence, or 3.3%, to 95 pence ($1.49).
</p>
<p>
   For the half, Trafalgar swung to a pretax loss of #97.6 million
($152.9 million) in the fiscal half that ended March 31, compared
with a profit of 54 million a year earlier. The loss was just
slightly larger than expected by analysts. The dividend cut to 1.25
pence from 4.40 pence, was in line with expectations.
</p>
<p>
   The pretax loss includes an exceptional charge of 120 million, to
cover a writedown of property interests along with costs of layoffs
and restructuring.
</p>
<p>
   The current acting chairman, Alan Clements, will become a deputy
chairman of the group. Among other management changes, David Gawler,
chief financial officer of Hongkong Land, will become finance
director of Trafalgar in June. Mr. Gawler succeeds John Ansdell, who
is to leave the group during the next two months along with Dermot
McDermott, chairman of the Cunard Leisure division.

<DATELINE> WASHINGTON </DATELINE>
<TXT>
<p>
   Arthur Levitt Jr., a publisher and former chairman
of the American Stock Exchange, has been chosen by President Clinton
to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</p>
<p>
   The president has approved Mr. Levitt's nomination and an
announcement could come as early as this week, barring any
unforeseen developments, according to Clinton administration
sources.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Levitt emerged as the leading candidate for the post a month
ago, after passing the early favorite, Consuela Washington, a top
aide to Michigan Rep. John Dingell, the chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee.
</p>
<p>
   However, even Mr. Levitt's supporters conceded that his selection
was delayed while the White House considered the political fallout
from picking him over Ms. Washington -- who would have advanced the
president's goals of hiring women and minorities -- and conducted
thorough "vetting" of his business history.
</p>
<p>
   Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Levitt was
accused by a rival publisher of using confidential information in
the purchase of Roll Call, his successful Capitol Hill newspaper.
Mr. Levitt says there was nothing improper in his purchase of the
newspaper. The White House has acknowledged that the story caused
some pause in their process, but didn't derail him.
</p>
<p>
   Still, friends say that earlier this month, Mr. Levitt expressed
some doubts as to whether he would get the job.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Levitt's candidacy was quietly pushed by Connecticut Sen.
Christopher Dodd, who is chairman of the Senate banking subcommittee
on securities. Mr. Levitt also helped raise $3.5 million at a New
York fund-raiser for President Clinton last fall, even though he
didn't support him in the primaries.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Levitt comes from a political family. His father, Arthur
Levitt Sr., was state comptroller in New York from 1955 through
1978, and holds the record for the most votes ever received by a
state politician.
</p>
<p>
   As SEC chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr. would succeed Richard Breeden,
a Republican appointee who is stepping down a few months before his
term ends. Mr. Levitt, who is 62 years old, will join three SEC
commissioners who have yet to turn 40. A fourth commission seat is
vacant.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Breeden, who had originally announced that he would step down
as chairman on April 15, is staying on through next week. He is said
to be mulling several jobs, including offers from law firms.
</p>
<p>
   Of the SEC actions pending this year, few are more anticipated
than the commission's Market 2000 report, an exhaustive study of the
future of the U.S. capital markets. The report, originally slated
for release this spring, is now expected to be released in the fall.
</p>
<p>
   SEC staff members working on the report said the absence of a new
chairman didn't delay the report's release, but they indicated that
they would like to have the new chairman's blessing on the report.
</p>
<p>
   On a broader scale, the new SEC chairman will also inherit
important groundwork laid by Mr. Breeden for opening the U.S.
securities markets to foreign companies. The globalization of the
markets is important to the big New York exchanges as well as the
regional stock exchanges.
</p>
<p>
   "We're not just competing in the U.S. today but around the
world," said Leopold Korins, head of the Pacific Stock Exchange.
"This is a period in our history when I would like to think that the
chairman of the SEC would have a very strong vision of what the
marketplace will look like in the next few years."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Korins, who served on the disciplinary panel of the American
Stock Exchange, said he didn't have many direct dealings with Mr.
Levitt.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Levitt, who lives and works in New York, couldn't be reached
for comment last night. The nomination would require Senate
confirmation.

@  Sales of Existing Single-Family Homes
@  Fell in March Due to Floods and Storms
@  ----
@  By Jim Carlton
@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<DD> 04/27/93 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A2 </SO>
<IN> HOME CONSTRUCTION (HOM), REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS (REA) </IN>
<TXT>
<p>
   Existing single-family home sales slipped 2.9% in March to their
lowest level since last June, as flooding and snowstorms hammered
the nation's housing markets.
</p>
<p>
   The existing sales fell to an annualized, seasonally adjusted
pace of 3,360,000 during the month from a revised pace of 3,460,000
in February, according to the National Association of Realtors. The
March pace was also off from the year-earlier rate of 3.5 million.
</p>
<p>
   Housing analysts said that underlying demand remains strong,
however, and that sales have picked up briskly through many parts of
the country since a blizzard slammed into the Eastern seaboard last
month and effectively shut down sales for several days.
</p>
<p>
   Indeed, the Mortgage Bankers Association's weekly index of home
loan purchase volume is running about 61% above normal as buyers
flock into the market due to increased affordability from a renewed
drop in residential mortgage rates to their lowest level in 20
years. The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage fell to 7.46% Friday from
7.50% the previous week, according to a survey of lenders by HSH
Associates Inc., a Butler, N.J., mortgage publishing firm.
</p>
<p>
   "We're seeing singles, childless couples and families with kids,
all trying to get the best buy with the lowest rate," said William
S. Chee, president of the Realtors' trade group, based in
Washington, D.C., and a Honolulu broker. "Both entry-level and
trade-up segments of the market are busy."
</p>
<p>
   John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the trade group, added that
housing may be one of the brightest points of the economy. "The
economy will continue to struggle but move forward, bolstered
considerably by a strong housing industry," Mr. Tuccillo said. "Low
rates, better conditions for trade-up buyers and an ample supply of
first-time buyers will make the market sing into the summer."
</p>
<p>
   Richard J. Loughlin, president and chief executive of Century 21
Real Estate Corp., the Irvine, Calif., brokerage unit of
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., said that his company's sales
nationwide surged 35% in March from February and that April sales
are continuing strong. He said that his brokers report pickups in
activity throughout the country, and that even hardest-hit Southern
California shows a sign of life.
</p>
<p>
   Steven Cochrane, senior economist at Regional Financial
Associates, a West Chester, Pa., consulting firm, said the housing
markets are strongest in what he describes as a "Southern crescent"
that begins in North Carolina, extends to the Gulf Coast, west to
Texas and then up to Denver.
</p>
<p>
   "That's where most of the employment growth is occurring right
now," Mr. Cochrane said. "The residential realestate markets have
started to bounce back."
</p>
<p>
   The stable Midwest has led the housing recovery, and in March
existing-home sales there rose 3.3% from February. Sales in the East
and South were off, influenced both by bad weather and continued
economic sluggishness in the Northeast. The West remained moribund
in March, as California's huge housing market suffered from both
unusually rainy weather and continued recession.
</p>
<p>
   California's existing-home sales in March fell 7.9% to an
annualized, seasonally adjusted pace of 384,220 from 416,950 in
February, according to the California Association of Realtors.
</p>
<p>
   Like the National Association of Realtors, most of the sales
measured by the California trade group are those that closed in the
month. A better leading indicator of housing sales is the mortgage
banker's index of loan purchase volume.

   Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner Inc.'s chairman, chief
executive officer and president, collected 1992 compensation of $3.6
million, up about 29% from 1991.
</p>
<p>
   According to the big entertainment and publishing company's 1992
proxy statement, Mr. Levin received about $1.1 million in salary and
a bonus of $2.5 million. In addition, Mr. Levin exercised options on
102,764 shares for a paper profit of $2.1 million.
</p>
<p>
   The company cited several factors for the increase, including the
rise in the company's stock price last year, debt restructuring and
completion of a strategic alliance with Toshiba Corp. and Itochu
Corp., formerly C. Itoh & Co. that resulted in a $1 billion
investment. Moreover, Mr. Levin, though filling the post of co-chief
executive officer in 1992, served as the company's sole top officer
for most of the year because of the cancer-related illness of the
late Steven J. Ross, co-chief executive and chairman.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Levin has since been named to the company's top three posts.

@  Approval Is Likely

<p>
   Rupert Murdoch took control of the New York Post, but
failed to convince some analysts he is doing the right thing.
</p>
<p>
   At the same time, it appears Mr. Murdoch will get the federal
approval he needs to own both a newspaper and a television station
in New York.
</p>
<p>
   A federal bankruptcy court judge accepted a plan under which Mr.
Murdoch, chairman of media concern News Corp., took management
control of the tabloid newspaper from court-designated owner Abraham
Hirschfeld. The Post will now be run by a News Corp. subsidiary
while Mr. Murdoch negotiates with union workers and federal
regulators to buy back the Post.
</p>
<p>
   Spirits were high at the paper after a newsroom appearance by Mr.
Murdoch, who owned the paper from 1976 to 1988. But they fell after
it was made public that Post editor Pete Hamill would be replaced
with Ken Chandler, the executive producer of Fox Broadcasting's "A
Current Affair." Mr. Chandler has worked as editor of News Corp.'s
Boston Herald and as managing editor at the Post during Mr.
Murdoch's earlier tenure.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Murdoch also named Patrick Purcell, chief executive officer
of News Corp.'s News America's Publishing unit, as the Post's new
publisher. Mr. Purcell will remain publisher and president of the
Boston Herald.
</p>
<p>
   Under terms of the management contract, Mr. Murdoch will operate
the Post for at least 60 days, covering all of its operating
expenses. While the paper is said to have advertising and
circulation revenue of close to $1 million a week, it is estimated
to have a weekly operating deficit of as much as $300,000.
</p>
<p>
   Several media analysts have found Mr. Murdoch's interest in the
Post puzzling, and at least one firm, Alex. Brown & Sons, lowered
its recommendation of News Corp.'s American depositary shares to
"neutral" from "buy." Alex. Brown analyst Drew Marcus largely
attributed the move to a "cold streak" at the box office for Fox
films, but said he also "questioned the logic behind buying the New
York Post." In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, News Corp.'s American depositary shares were unchanged at
$41.25.
</p>
<p>
   As Mr. Murdoch negotiates with the paper's unions and creditors,
he must work to win a waiver from Federal Communications Commission
regulations that bar cross-ownership of media properties.
</p>
<p>
   While officials have hinted at it, FCC Chairman James Quello
indicated the agency is likely to approve Mr. Murdoch's request for
a waiver of FCC rules that bar common ownership of a newspaper and
television station in the same market. "It looks very good here," he
said. Mr. Murdoch was forced by Congress to sell the Post after
acquiring New York's WNYW-TV in 1986. This time, key lawmakers,
including Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who
is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, have said they don't
plan to oppose joint ownership.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Murdoch, however, ran into spirited opposition from Hispanic
groups. Rainbow Broadcasting Inc. -- a group of Los Angeles-area
Hispanic broadcasters and community leaders who have been fighting
Fox Television Stations Inc.'s application to renew its FCC license
for KTTV-TV in Los Angeles since 1988 -- and the New York chapter of
the National Hispanic Media Coalition, said they would oppose Mr.
Murdoch's efforts to obtain the FCC waiver.
</p>
<p>
   In a joint statement, the two groups said they will fight the
waiver. They claim the lengthy litigation in the KTTV-TV case has
shown a "pattern of misconduct" by Fox and Mr. Murdoch, and that
joint ownership would lead to unjustifiable concentration of media
ownership in the New York market. In addition, the groups said that
Mr. Murdoch's efforts to win "advance approval for an FCC waiver
appear to have compromised the integrity of the commission's
regulatory procedures."

   Earth Technology Corp. expects to post net income of between
$380,000 and $430,000, or 12 cents to 14 cents a share, for its
second quarter, ended Feb. 26, Creighton Early, chief financial
officer, said.
</p>
<p>
   That compares with a net loss of $638,000, or 22 cents a share,
in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the latest quarter rose to
around $15.5 million from $11.7 million, Mr. Early said in an
interview in Long Beach, Calif.
</p>
<p>
   For the six months, the company will post net income of between
$750,000 and $800,000, or 24 cents to 26 cents a share, on revenue
of about $30 million, he said. For the first six months of fiscal
1992, it had a net loss of $576,000, or 19 cents a share, on revenue
of $25.7 million.
</p>
<p>
   Diane Creel, recently promoted to chief executive officer, said
the return to profitability reflects the success of the company's
"back-to-basics" strategy focusing on its core government and
commercial hazardous-waste consulting businesses. The company
floundered in recent years when its diversification efforts soured
as the recession hit.

<p>
   The New York Post has returned to the brink of
extinction.
</p>
<p>
   The ailing tabloid filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday, on
the same day it failed to publish any editions, its new owner fired
then rehired staffers, and a would-be rescuer continued his fight to
step in.
</p>
<p>
   Angry staffers thwarted the publication of the 192-year-old
tabloid paper on Monday, after learning the new court-designated
owner, Abraham Hirschfeld, planned immediate firings of more than
200 employees. That marked one of the few times in its history that
the Post failed to publish. The Post plans to publish today, and if
it does, Post insiders said it would carry stories attacking Mr.
Hirschfeld.
</p>
<p>
   Earlier yesterday, many Newspaper Guild union members were
notified they were being fired, but by late afternoon Post insiders
said most of those firings were rescinded. It was unclear whether
that included several top managers. Neither Mr. Hirschfeld nor the
managers could be reached for comment.
</p>
<p>
   In U.S. bankruptcy court, meanwhile, Steven Hoffenberg, until
last week a bidder for the Post, and Post creditors were petitioning
to overturn the planned sale to Mr. Hirschfeld. Mr. Hirschfeld's own
commitment came into question yesterday, as wire services quoted the
real estate developer as saying he was more interested in buying the
Post's building rather than the newspaper itself. He also was quoted
as saying he might step aside if Gov. Mario Cuomo came forward with
a new group of investors.
</p>
<p>
   Yesterday, the Post filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
federal court in New York, at the direction of Mr. Hirschfeld with
the approval of current owner Peter Kalikow. Post sources said the
filing was aimed at insulating the paper from claims by Mr.
Hoffenberg, who may try to collect on $6 million he already had
invested in the newspaper. Mr. Hoffenberg, chairman of Towers
Financial Corp., had originally won the right to buy the paper but
couldn't close the deal because of continuing trouble with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

   Advanced Medical Inc. announced changes in top
officers, said it expects to take a $1.5 million pretax
first-quarter charge for certain cost-cutting steps, and reported
fourth-quarter net income of $2.5 million compared with a
year-earlier loss.
</p>
<p>
   The company, whose main operating unit, IMED Corp., is a major
producer of medical intravenous equipment, said Henry Green, who was
president and chief operating officer, resigned those posts and has
been succeeded temporarily by Stanley S. Anders III, who retains
earlier responsibilities as chief financial officer.
</p>
<p>
   Advanced Medical said Mr. Green will remain a director and a
consultant to the company. Mr. Green said he resigned to save the
company money to eliminate duplication in management of the parent
and the unit.
</p>
<p>
   Advanced Medical also said Jeffry M. Picower was elected to the
board and named a co-chairman with Richard D. Propper, who has been
the company's chairman. Mr. Picower, who is chairman and chief
executive officer of Monroe Systems for Business Inc., had held the
same position in 1988 and 1989 with a predecessor company of
Advanced Medical, the company said.
</p>
<p>
   Advanced Medical said it expects to take its $1.5 million pretax
charge in connection with steps that the company believes will save
about $3 million in annual expenses compared with last year.
</p>
<p>
   The company said its fourth-quarter net income equaled about 14
cents a share. The net loss in the 1991 fourth quarter totaled $1.1
million, or 12 cents a share, including $1.2 million in one-time
charges for the early extinguishment of debt. Revenue rose 13%, to
$40.9 million from $36.4 million.

   The New York Daily News named Lou Colasuonno to be
editor of the newspaper. Mr. Colasuonno, 44 years old, was editor of
the New York Post, the longtime rival of the Daily News.
</p>
<p>
   The Daily News was recently purchased by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, a
real estate developer and publisher of the magazine U.S. News &
World Report.
</p>
<p>
   Two other top editors at the Post, managing editor James Lynch
and metropolitan editor Richard Gooding, also quit to join the News,
Reuters reported. It said the move stunned reporters at the Post,
which only eight days ago came within minutes of shutting its doors
after 192 years of continuous publishing.

   Steven Hoffenberg, the businessman who took over the Post and
promised to keep it going while he completed its purchase, vowed to
sue the News for poaching his staff, Reuters said.

   The news service said that also leaving was the Post's lead
columnist, Mike McAlary, who last week wrote that he was willing to
give Mr. Hoffenberg a chance.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Colasuonno is known for attention-grabbing stories and page
one headlines. He called quitting the Post the hardest thing he ever
did, according to Reuters. "This is the best paper in town because
of the people in this room," he said in a newsroom speech before
breaking down in tears. Mr. Colasuonno didn't give details on why he

@  Clinton Turns Focus to Economic Plan

<TXT>
<p>
   Hoping to move beyond the controversies that
clouded his first days in office, President Clinton spent the
weekend conferring with his cabinet and plans to spend this week
nailing down the initial details of his economic plan.
</p>
<p>
   The weekend retreat at Camp David was designed to get the cabinet
working together to make progress on Mr. Clinton's top priorities:
economic revitalization, health care overhaul, national service, and
revising campaign-finance and lobbying laws. These goals were
hindered by clashes over the president's ill-fated selection of Zoe
Baird for attorney general and his stunted attempt to allow
homosexuals to serve in the military.
</p>
<p>
   The president's aides said their efforts this week will be
devoted largely to deciding what components to include in Mr.
Clinton's economic plan, which is set to be unveiled Feb. 17. It
will be composed of three parts: short-term economic stimulus in the
form of new spending, long-term investment, which will include tax
breaks, and a big package of spending cuts and tax increases to
reduce the budget deficit over time.
</p>
<p>
   Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton hasn't yet chosen an appointee for
attorney general since Mrs. Baird withdrew her name, and aides said
finding a replacement could take as long as a week or more. U.S.
District Judge Rya Zobel of Boston has been interviewed for the job,
however, and the president is also said to be considering several
others, including Andrea Ordin, a former prosecutor in Los Angeles,
U.S. Appeals Judge Richard Arnold of Little Rock, Ark., and U.S.
District Judge Abner Mikva of Washington.
</p>
<p>
   Officials said the No. 2 and 3 posts under the attorney general
are close to being filled: Charles Ruff, a former Watergate
prosecutor and former Justice Department aide, will likely be chosen
for deputy attorney general, and Webster Hubbell, a friend of Mr.
Clinton and former law partner of Mrs. Clinton, is expected to be
picked for associate attorney general.
</p>
<p>
   Separately, President Clinton nominated John Rollwagen, the
chairman and chief executive officer of Cray Research Inc., as the
No. 2 Commerce Department official. Mr. Rollwagen said he wants to
push the Clinton administration to aggressively confront U.S.
trading partners such as Japan to open their markets, particularly
for high-tech industries.
</p>
<p>
   In a letter sent throughout the Eagan, Minn.-based company on
Friday, Mr. Rollwagen warned: "Whether we like it or not, our
country is in an economic war; and we are at a key turning point in
that war." He added, "The next few years will tell if the U.S.
continues to play a leadership role in the new information age, or
whether we will recede into a secondary role behind the Japanese and
the Europeans and Koreans and Taiwanese and others."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Rollwagen is on record as seeking to open Japanese markets.
Last year, he publicly blasted the Japanese for giving a
multimillion-dollar supercomputer contract to NEC Corp., a huge
Japanese electronics company, instead of to Cray. In congressional
testimony, he protested that NEC was picked for "political, not
technical reasons," and said that the decision "confirms our belief
that the Japanese market continues to be manipulated."
</p>
<p>
   Cray Research said it has appointed John F. Carlson, its
president and chief operating officer, to succeed Mr. Rollwagen.
</p>
<p>
   Meanwhile, the administration is recruiting Rufus Yerxa for the
No. 2 position in the U.S. trade representative's office, according
to trade officials. Mr. Yerxa has represented the U.S. in
discussions to open European and Japanese markets.
</p>
<p>
   And Mexico-born political economist, Raul Hinojosa Ojeda, is
being considered for an assistant trade representative post. Mr.
Hinojosa, a University of California, Los Angeles, professor with
extensive Mexican experience, would help negotiate an environmental
and labor pact to supplement the North American Free Trade Accord.
</p>
<p>
   In his academic writings, Mr. Hinojosa has pushed for a North
American adjustment fund and development bank similar to those used
in the European Community to aid poorer nations and Eastern Europe.

<HL>    LEISURE & ARTS -- Architecture:
@  A Pocket of Neotraditional Planning
@  ----
@  By Eve M. Kahn </HL>
<DD> 01/29/93 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12 </SO>
<TXT>
<p>
   Elk Grove, Calif. -- Right here, at the flat-as-prairie southern
frontier of Sacramento, Peter Calthorpe is trying to earn a spot in
the annals of suburban history. After philosophizing for more than a
decade about the senselessness of current planning standards, this
San Francisco-based visionary is building a "pedestrian pocket"
called Laguna West. And he just might set off a wave of
neotraditional planning, for better and for worse.
</p>
<p>
   Just like Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, the Miami
planners who designed Seaside, Fla., Mr. Calthorpe proclaims that
new subdivisions can fight pollution and acquire a sense of place
with tight grids of thin streets, mixed housing types and easily
accessible parks, stores and mass transit. But unlike his East Coast
counterparts, he does not impose rigidly regionalist and costly
architectural standards that can cause mass-market architects to
produce half-kitsch-half-arty mutants.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Calthorpe instead lets developers build what they like
(provided porches cover facades and garages are tucked to the side
or around back). But he strictly controls public amenities, thereby
producing a mix of unabashedly lowbrow architecture with clever
street details and layouts.
</p>
<p>
   Laguna West's developer, Phil Angelides (chairman of California's
Democratic Party), planned in 1989 to slather the site with the
usual confusing spaghetti-snarl of streets. But soon after local
officials approved his plan, he fell for the charms of Mr.
Calthorpe's spiels and renderings. On paper, Laguna West is an
exquisite revival of beaux-arts planning: a symmetrical quilt of
brightly colored squares (each hue signifying a different use or
population density), with alleys, sidewalks and vintage-style lamp
posts set along byways and grand boulevards, and with 38 acres of
park around a 73-acre manmade lake studded with inhabited islands.
</p>
<p>
   Currently the thousand-acre site is two-thirds raw dirt and
one-third park, town hall, amphitheater, lake and one hundred
single-family homes that are all hilarious. Norman, craftsman,
colonial, Queen Anne, Tuscan, Tudor and Egyptian details pop up
wherever they can; overgrown window sills resemble fat lips and
almost bump into adjacent porch rails; perfunctory front porches can
barely shelter single chairs. (Like low-end Victoriana, this stuff
could take up to eight decades to acquire dignity and charm -- but
at least it will never put on elitist airs.)
</p>
<p>
   The public spaces are less aggressive: In fact, the collaboration
of Mr. Calthorpe and landscape architect Ken Kay seems rather
wishy-washy, torn between modernity and nostalgia. The town hall is
just a dusty-peach-and-gray concrete box with mint timber trim, the
amphitheater alongside it a simple grass bowl, the park land a lawn
strip flanked by poplar and oak trees and zigzagging garden beds,
the waterfront tamely furnished with neo-Victorian benches and peach
light fixtures.
</p>
<p>
   Clearly, however, mainstream America could thrive in this
setting. Almost every new home for sale in the Sacramento region
bears a blatant resemblance to Laguna West's motley assortment, down
to the turned-baluster interior stair rails and the improbable
display ledges perched eight feet up the walls of
cathedral-ceilinged living rooms. "It really is cute here, and the
price was right," Rita Livingston, a recent Laguna West homebuyer,
told me.
</p>
<p>
   My own favorite parts of Laguna West are the subtle
underpinnings: the neverending sidewalks; the numerous gate-free
entrances and cross-complex thoroughfares (you rarely feel
disoriented or walled in); the street trees in concrete wells that
protrude three feet into the roadways (to prevent drag racing but
not discourage curbside parking); the tree codes that could smooth
out the architectural chaos. (Mr. Kay specified single species for
each roadside: only live oaks on Gropius Street, for instance, and
only bloodgood sycamores along Mumford Court -- that's right, the
streets ambitiously bear the names of past architectural masters.)
</p>
<p>
   All of these twists in the neotraditional canon are relatively
easy to copy, and ideally they will be, as the trend takes over the
postrecession landscape. (There's even talk these days of
retrofitting existing communities and malls along neotraditional
lines -- can't you just imagine cruising through orchards at the
feet of Safeways?)
</p>
<p>
   But if you find the whole neotraditional prospect disturbingly
anticity (as I still sometimes do), you will be pleased to learn
that Laguna West feels the need to fill its brochures with
references to the ways porches and friendly sidewalks might deter
street evils. Yes, it may look peaceful here, but Laguna West's town
hall nonetheless offers children courses in "Stranger Danger" and in
self-fingerprinting.
</p>
<p>
   Somehow it's reassuring to know that, while we are building and
escaping to unprecedentedly sanitized versions of urbanism, we're
not leaving behind our urban angst.

<p>
   Drug Emporium Inc., citing increased
competition from grocery stores, posted a fiscal third-quarter loss
and said it may further tighten management ranks.
</p>
<p>
   The discount drugstore chain said it had a loss of $2.9 million,
or 17 cents a share, in the quarter ended Nov. 28. In the year-ago
quarter, Drug Emporium earned $637,000, or five cents a share, on
sales of $177.8 million.
</p>
<p>
   Total sales in the quarter rose 3.1% to $183.3 million, but
same-store sales declined 4%. "In a low-cost, low-margin business, a
number like 4% is significant," said Vice Chairman Gary Wilber.
</p>
<p>
   Results were also hurt by increased sales, general and
administrative costs, which increased 15% to $39.2 million for the
quarter, said Gary Dennis, an analyst at J.C. Bradford in Knoxville,
Tenn.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Wilber said the chain took several cost-cutting steps in the
last month, including laying off three executives and eliminating
their posts. The three are Richard Landers, who was vice president
of merchandise and marketing; Robert Ramsey, director of marketing;
and Frank Shanower, vice president of trade relations.
</p>
<p>
   Drug Emporium also cut management pay by 5%, froze hiring and
eliminated some executive perquisites. Mr. Wilber said the board
will consider further cuts when it meets later this month.
</p>
<p>
   The chain has been in constant turmoil in recent years. In the
last 18 months, it has fired two chief financial officers, retired
its founding chairman and chief executive, Philip I. Wilber, and
shunted Mr. Wilber's successor, his son Gary, into the newly created
post of vice chairman. The new chairman and chief executive,
longtime director David L. Kriegle, assumed his posts last week.
</p>
<p>
   The elder Mr. Wilber remains on payroll as a founding chairman.
But that post may be eliminated, along with three other posts, later
this month, the younger Mr. Wilber said.
</p>
<p>
   Investors had hoped that Drug Emporium could push through price
increases after rival Phar-Mor Inc. filed for bankruptcy-law
protection last year. But instead, Drug Emporium found increased
competition from grocery stores with health and beauty sections, and
from mass merchandisers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Given all the
competition, "I don't think Drug Emporium has a particularly viable
format," Scott & Stringfellow Inc. analyst Neal Kaplan said.
</p>
<p>
   Drug Emporium is a national chain of 136 company-owned stores and
98 franchised stores. In national over-the-counter trading
yesterday, its shares slipped 62.5 cents to $4.875.

<p>
   The choice of a successor to James Robinson III as
American Express Co.'s chairman and chief executive officer appears
headed for a showdown.
</p>
<p>
   The company's five-person search committee is meeting here today
to decide whom to recommend to the 19-member board, which meets
Monday. Two committees made up of 14 directors, some of whom are
also on the search committee, will be meeting today as well.
</p>
<p>
   Two leading outside candidates are said to be chief executives of
major consumer-products concerns. But Mr. Robinson is backing Harvey
Golub, American Express's 53-year-old president.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Robinson has declined to comment. But according to one person
close to the situation, Mr. Robinson believes he has enough support
on the board to make Mr. Golub chief executive under an arrangement
that would let Mr. Robinson remain chairman for an indefinite
period.
</p>
<p>
   "Jimmy thinks he has between 12 and 14 votes, and all he needs is
10 votes," the individual said. "Throughout the search process, he
has been working like hell to line up board votes" for Mr. Golub.
Mr. Robinson's goal has been "to make sure that it isn't an
outsider" who succeeds him as chief executive, the individual added.
</p>
<p>
   But other people close to the board say Mr. Robinson may not have
enough support to push through his own choice of sucessor. For one
thing, even if he does get 12 to 14 votes, the board may want the
decision to be nearly unanimous. Although most directors remain
loyal to Mr. Robinson, at least five are believed to be opposed to
Mr. Golub.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Robinson may simply find himself bargaining for either a
future role for himself at the company or a promise that Mr. Golub
will have a shot at the CEO spot within five years.
</p>
<p>
   There is likely to be at least informal discussion of the CEO
issue as board members gather in New York today to discuss 1992
financial results.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Robinson apparently lacked enough votes to anoint Mr. Golub
when the succession drama began last fall. At a supper meeting the
night before the board met in September, Mr. Robinson, 57, told
board members he didn't plan to stay in his post past the age of 60.
Directors then surprised Mr. Robinson by demanding his departure in
the near future.
</p>
<p>
   Directors are eager to avoid a repetition of the divisive
September meeting, when sides were drawn over whether to seek an
immediate successor to Mr. Robinson.
</p>
<p>
   The board decided to begin its search, including interviewing
outside candidates, because it wanted to quell a possible coup led
by one outside director. Rawleigh Warner Jr., the retired chairman
of Mobil Corp., is said to have proposed Mr. Robinson's immediate
ouster and, according to an article in the New Yorker magazine this
week, his replacement by an interim executive committee of
directors. The person close to the situation said those reports are
accurate. Mr. Warner couldn't be reached to comment.
</p>
<p>
   Though the identities of the two leading outside candidates are
unknown, a number of names have popped up on Wall Street and among
executive recruiters as fitting the search committee's criteria: a
seasoned consumer-products executive who has led his company through
significant challenges. Among them are Reuben Mark, chairman and CEO
of Colgate-Palmolive Co.; John Sculley, chairman and CEO of Apple
Computer Inc.; Robert L. Crandall, chairman, president and CEO of
AMR Corp.; William D. Smithburg, chairman and CEO of Quaker Oats
Co.; John H. Bryan, chairman and CEO of Sara Lee Corp.; and Roger A.
Enrico, chairman of PepsiCo Inc.'s Worldwide Foods business.
</p>
<p>
   Tuesday, Mr. Enrico issued an internal staff memo denying that he
was a candidate. A Sara Lee insider said there was "no way" that Mr.
Bryan would accept the helm of American Express. Through a
spokesman, Mr. Sculley said he is happy at Apple and has no plans to
leave. Mr. Crandall, through a spokesman, said, "There is absolutely
no substance to that speculation."
</p>
<p>
   A Quaker Oats spokesman said, "We're just simply not going to
comment" on speculation about Mr. Smithburg and American Express.
And Mr. Mark at Colgate declined to comment, citing company policy
about discussing matters at other companies.
</p>
<p>
   Contenders for CEO jobs almost never concede that they're under
consideration because they could jeopardize their current position,
executive recruiters say.
</p>
<p>
   American Express hired executive recruiters Heidrick & Struggles
Inc. to assist in its search. Gerard Roche, the firm's chairman,
said Mr. Robinson and Richard M. Furlaud, an outside director and
former president of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., "are in control of the
process" as co-chairmen of the search committee. The search for Mr.
Robinson's successor "should be reaching a conclusion within a
reasonable time," Mr. Roche said, but he declined to comment
further.
</p>
<p>
   But while American Express personnel and its major investors are
eager for the issue to be resolved, an announcement won't
necessarily follow Monday's meeting.
</p>
<p>
   "We may simply evaluate and then give more direction to the
search committee," said one director, who asked not to be named.
</p>
<p>
   Silence on the issue beyond Monday, however, would indicate to
many that Mr. Golub is out of the running. "How much time do they
need to size him up?" asked a former executive of the company. The
former executive said a number of directors were favorably impressed
with Mr. Golub at the November board meeting. There, he and Kenneth
Chenault, head of the U.S. card operations of Travel Related
Services, described progress that had been made in persuading
American Express customers to use their credit cards more
frequently.

@  Treasury Prices Ease as Bond Players Display
@  Wait-and-See Attitude on Clinton Economic Plan

<p>
   The bond market didn't seem as enthralled with
Inauguration Day as were many people in the nation's capital and
most Treasury prices dropped slightly.
</p>
<p>
   The benchmark 30-year bond, for example, dropped more than 1/4
point to 103 15/32 to yield 7.33%, up from 7.30% on Tuesday. The
10-year note dropped less than 1/4 point to 98 11/32 to yield 6.59%,
up from 6.57%. But the two-year note rose less than 1/8 point to 100
15/32 to yield 4.35%, down from 4.39%.
</p>
<p>
   "Mr. Clinton's inauguration did not have an effect on the market"
yesterday, said Bryan R. Scarfone, head of government trading at SBC
Government Securities, a unit of Swiss Bank. Traders said that the
bond markets have adopted a wait-and-see attitude with regard to the
new president and are unlikely to react until he starts announcing
the details of his economic plan.
</p>
<p>
   Bond investors will be watching for clues as to how President
Clinton will fulfill campaign promises to help revive the economy
while reducing the federal budget deficit at the same time.
Investors seem to have factored in the likelihood of a $20 billion
to $30 billion short-term spending package, though President Clinton
has made no formal announcement of such a package.
</p>
<p>
   The new president will have a chance today to make at least a
symbolic show of his commitment to reducing the federal budget
deficit, a big concern of the bond markets. President Clinton must
decide by today whether to adjust deficit ceilings written into the
1990 deficit-reduction law, thus rendering the ceilings meaningless,
or leave the ceilings unchanged and risk across-the-board spending
cuts in the future.
</p>
<p>
   The decision is considered more symbolic than concrete because it
wouldn't involve much money. Nevertheless, the bond markets will be
watching closely because it will be an early indicator of where the
president stands on the issue of deficit reduction.
</p>
<p>
   The 1990 budget law did away with such fixed ceilings for the
deficit through the end of this fiscal year but imposes them again
for fiscal 1994, which begins Oct. 1, and the following year. The
system of deficit limits and automatic spending cuts was originally
established by the 1985 Gramm-Rudman law.
</p>
<p>
   The 1990 budget law gives Mr. Clinton a one-time chance to adjust
the ceilings to reflect changes in the economy and technical
estimates that have occurred since January of last year. His
transition aides have said that he will probably make the
adjustment, thus making the ceilings irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
   "More generally, the current budget rules are likely to be
reworked to reflect the changed budget priorities Clinton brings to
the presidency," commented Shearson Lehman Brothers political
analyst Thomas D. Gallagher in a company newsletter. "Aspects like
the discretionary spending targets, and possibly the firewalls
between defense and nondefense spending for fiscal 1993, will be
altered."
</p>
<p>
   Early trading in the Treasury market yesterday was a continuation
of the recent trend where longer maturities outperformed short and
intermediate-term issues. However, the buying that had been helping
longer issues in the past few sessions faded, resulting in a modest
correction by day's end.
</p>
<p>
   Among the positions being unwound were what is known as curve
flattening trades. When the difference between yields on long-term
securities and short-term securities narrows, that is known as a
flattening yield curve.
</p>
<p>
   Traders who had sought to profit from that movement had bought
the 30-year Treasury bond and sold Treasurys with shorter
maturities, but a few reversed themselves yesterday.
</p>
<p>
   The spread between the two-year note and the 30-year bond widened
slightly to 2.97 percentage points by late in the day. The spread
had narrowed sharply by 0.14 percentage point Tuesday to finish at
2.94 percentage points.
</p>
<p>
   President Clinton's inaugural address yielded no new specifics,
which appeared to disappoint some in the market and may have added
to the selling at the long end. "It was basically a cheerleading
speech, but the market was hoping for something more than that, and
it didn't happen," said Michael Strauss, chief economist at Yamaichi
International (America) Inc.
</p>
<p>
   Today is expected to be another relatively quiet session. The
Federal Reserve is slated to release its so-called Beige Book report
on economic activity and the Treasury will announce the size of next
week's two-year and five-year note auctions. Analysts expect the
two-year note offering to total $15.5 billion and the five-year to
total $11.25 billion, both unchanged from the December auctions.
</p>
<p>
   Due to the federal holiday yesterday, the weekly jobless claims
figures and the Federal Reserve's money supply and banking data will
be delayed one day until tomorrow.

   Corporate & Junk Bonds
@
</p>
<p>
   Citicorp sold bonds to overwhelming investor demand yesterday
while junk bonds gained 1/4 to 1/2 point in strong buying.
</p>
<p>
   Investment-grade issues, meanwhile, finished flat to down 1/8
point in moderate activity.
</p>
<p>
   Despite more than $27 billion of new corporate issuance so far
this year, the gaps between the yields for corporate bonds and
Treasurys have held steady, traders say, suggesting that investors'
appetite for corporate bonds continues to match supply.
</p>
<p>
   The primary market turned in another strong session, with new
issuance totaling $1.1 billion. Yesterday's borrowers included
Citicorp, H.J. Heinz Co., Champion International Corp. and Alabama
Power Co., a unit of Southern Co.
</p>
<p>
   Despite a nearly 0.17 percentage point drop in long-term interest
rates since Jan. 9, issuance remains confined to notes maturing in
seven to 10 years. However, some syndicate officials said that could
change if the Treasury 30-year bond falls below 7.25%. The 30-year
bond yielded 7.33% as of late yesterday.
</p>
<p>
   Among specific junk issues, bonds of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.
climbed in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Traders said that
the company is expected to purchase an unspecified amount of its
subordinated debt in the secondary market.
</p>
<p>
   Bonds of Unisys Corp. also rose. The computer systems
manufacturer reported strong fourth-quarter earnings early
yesterday. Standard & Poor's Corp. later placed the company's senior
and subordinated debt ratings on CreditWatch with positive
implications.
</p>
<p>
   In other news, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said the credit
quality of U.S. corporations moderately improved in 1992 after a
steep three-year slide. While the country's corporate health is
expected to remain less than robust in 1993, Moody's added, "the gap
between corporate downgrades and upgrades will continue to narrow."
</p>
<p>
   Citicorp priced a $400 million issue of 10-year subordinated
notes at par to yield 8%. The noncallable issue was priced at a
spread of 1.43 percentage points above the Treasury 10-year note.
</p>
<p>
   Rated Baa-3 by Moody's and triple-B-plus by S&P, the issue will
be sold through underwriters led by Citicorp Securities Markets Inc.
</p>
<p>
   One dealer involved in the pricing said the offering was
originally expected to total $250 million, but was increased after
investors registered "overwhelming demand."
</p>
<p>
   On Tuesday, Citicorp reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter
earnings of $280 million, or 53 cents a share, compared with a loss
of $133 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. S&P
subsequently revised its ratings outlook on Citicorp and its units
to stable from negative.

<p>
   Municipal Bonds
@
</p>
<p>
   Prices of municipal bonds ended higher, although much of the
action in the tax-exempt market yesterday was in the primary market.
</p>
<p>
   In secondary trading, the North Carolina Municipal Power Agency's
6.20% revenue bonds of 2018 rose 1/4 to 99 1/4, to yield 6.24%.
</p>
<p>
   Among new issues, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's
$100 million of 84th Series revenue bonds, which were competitively
priced, were all sold by the end of the session.
</p>
<p>
   A Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. group is believed to have won the
bonds with a bid setting the net interest cost to the issuer at
about 6.275%.
</p>
<p>
   Interest on the bonds is subject to the federal alternative
minimum tax. Yields range from 5.80% in 2008 to 6.283% in 2028.
</p>
<p>
   The Port Authority expects to use proceeds of the sale for
certain capital expenditures at airport and marine terminal
facilities and for the refunding of certain obligations.
</p>
<p>
   Meanwhile, Guam Airport Authority's $247.9 million of Series A
and B general revenue bonds came out relatively strongly. At
repricing, yields ranged from 3.90% in 1994 to 6.748% in 2023.
Initially, the yields had ranged from 3.90% in 1994 to 6.82% in
2023.
</p>
<p>
   This is the first time the authority has come into the muni
marketplace and sold bonds solely on its credit rating. A Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. group served as lead manager of the
offering.
@
</p>
<p>
   Mortgage & Asset-Backed Securities
@
</p>
<p>
   Prices of mortgage securities ended slightly lower.
</p>
<p>
   Among secondary issues, Government National Mortgage Association
7.5% issues for February delivery ended 1/8 lower at 100 16/32,
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Gold 7.5% issues ended 5/32 lower
at 100 19/32 and Federal National Mortgage Association 7.5% issues
ended 5/32 lower at 100 12/32.
</p>
<p>
   About $1.5 billion of new real estate mortgage investment conduit
securities were announced yesterday, bringing the week's Remic
volume so far to $2.5 billion. That issuance is in addition to the
$3.5 billion of strips and modifiable and combinable securities also
priced this week.
</p>
<p>
   As expected, some 15-year collateral and 8% 30-year collateral
continue to be popular. In yesterday's issuance, the $400 million
Freddie Mac Gold 1472 deal was backed by Freddie Mac Gold 15-year 7%
securities, the $350 million Fannie Mae 1993-G5 deal was backed by
Ginnie Mae 30-year 8% issues and the $750 million Fannie Mae 1993-17
deal was backed by Fannie Mae 30-year 8% issues.
</p>
<p>
   Additionally, all of the heavy strips issuance this week used 8%
mortgage securities as collateral -- $1 billion from Freddie Mac and
$2.52 billion from Fannie Mae. 0240.00

<IN> DIVERSIFIED FINANCIAL SERVICES (FIS) </IN>
<TXT>
<p>
   The chief executive of a major consumer-products company is
emerging as a leading candidate to succeed James Robinson III as
chairman and chief executive of American Express Co.
</p>
<p>
   Growing support for the executive, whose identity wasn't
disclosed, on the committee conducting the search could force a
showdown between directors allied behind Harvey Golub, president of
the financial-services company, and those seeking a more seasoned
chief executive. The board is scheduled to meet next Sunday evening
and the following day.
</p>
<p>
   The executive, according to a person close to the search
committee, is one of "two excellent guys, both associated with
fixing things," at their companies who have been under review since
before Christmas. He declined to identify them. Neither is from a
financial services company, indicating that consumer marketing and
image building are considered the most important tasks at hand.
</p>
<p>
   While one of the executives is considered ahead of the other in
the running, the person close to the committee said both are chief
executives of major consumer-product companies and have proven
themselves in leading their companies to overcome significant
problems. One is in his early 50s, the other in his mid-50s, and
both are known for their hands-on management styles, he said.
</p>
<p>
   The next board meeting is likely to be Act II of the drama that
suddenly unfolded at a dinner meeting the night before the board met
in September and unceremoniously called for a search to begin that
could bring about the quick removal of Mr. Robinson, 57 years old.
</p>
<p>
   The person close to the search committee said the five-member
group is "close to a consensus" on one of the candidates, but that
it could "fall apart over terms and the due-diligence check."
Richard Furlaud, co-chairman of the committee and former chairman of
Bristol-Myers Inc., declined to comment when reached at his Florida
home.
</p>
<p>
   Board members who are eager to name an outsider as chief
executive, according to persons close to the board, include: David
Culver, retired chairman of Alcan Aluminium Ltd.; Rawleigh Warner
Jr., retired chairman of Mobil Corp.; John Byrne, chairman of Fund
American Companies Inc.; and William Bowen, president of the Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation. Also believed on their side is Howard Clark
Sr., a former American Express chairman and an adviser who attends
board meetings. Mr. Byrne declined comment when asked about the
report, and the others did not return phone calls or couldn't be
reached.
</p>
<p>
   But "the dissidents alone don't have the votes," on the 19-member
board to bring in an outsider, says one board member who asked not
to be identified. He added that the swing factor could be "if Jim
Robinson agrees to go to the outside" for his successor. Mr.
Robinson, who is co-chairman of the search committee, had been
grooming Mr. Golub to be his replacement. Many of the board members
remain loyal to Mr. Robinson, despite agreeing to the call for a new
chief executive soon. Efforts to reach Mr. Robinson were
unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>
   The board member added that if Mr. Robinson accedes to the call
for an outsider, "something has to be done to keep Harvey."
</p>
<p>
   Indeed, Mr. Golub, 53, has won high marks for re-engineering the
company's core Travel Related Services business, home of the Optima
credit card and American Express's charge cards. Since taking over
as chairman of the unit in the fall of 1991, he has launched a $1
billion cost-cutting plan, taken a more flexible approach to
merchant charges and support and boosted card spending through
innovative promotions.
</p>
<p>
   The level of support for him on the board is not clear. On
Thursday, Drew Lewis, a director and chief executive of Union
Pacific Corp., said, "If we had a vote, Harvey would win." But he
added he was not sure if there were yet enough votes for a
consensus, indicating that would be necessary for a final decision.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Lewis added that he does not feel American Express is in
"crisis" and that he would be satisfied if it took six months or
even a year to name a new chief executive, while Mr. Robinson and
Mr. Golub continue to head the company. Mr. Lewis declined to
discuss anything about the qualifications of any other candidates
for the job.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Lewis said Saturday that the situation had changed "since the
time I talked" and that he no longer felt as confident about Mr.
Golub's chances. He declined to say why, other than referring to
"new information" and an "alternative" candidate. Mr. Lewis would
only confirm that there are two serious outside candidates, but he
added that most of the board probably did not yet know the names of
the outside candidates. He declined to comment further on their
chances, saying, "These are matters for the board, not the press, to
discuss."
</p>
<p>
   An alternative to Mr. Golub is being sought, the person close to
the committee, said, because "Harvey is like the sophomore at West
Point who is getting all A's. But such a great company as American
Express needs a general who has already fought a few wars." He added
that an offer that might be made to keep him at the company is "an
understanding that if he performs well for three to five years" the
top post might then become available. But the ongoing role of Mr.
Golub has not yet been discussed at length with the candidates, he
added.
</p>
<p>
   American Express had been buffeted by large losses in the card
division and at a number of the financial businesses Mr. Robinson
had diversified the charge-card giant into during his 15-year reign.
The flagship American Express card, the center of the Travel Related
Services unit, also has been under siege from fierce credit card
competition at the customer and merchant levels.
</p>
<p>
   Large stockholders of American Express are eager for the chief
executive uncertainty to be resolved, says Alison Deans, an analyst
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "I hear from a lot of larger
holders of the stock that they want the company to do something, not
leave the situation in limbo." She adds that although she believes
the card division and the rest of the company are about to report a
fairly good quarter, "there are a lot of pressing issues. When there
is not clear decisive action, time is against them."
</p>
<p>
   The head of one of the five largest institutional holders of
American Express stock, however, not only wants the issue resolved
but says he wants to see Mr. Golub chosen. Although he has not
communicated with the board, he says, "I'd be surprised if they go
outside. I have a lot of confidence in him."
</p>
<p>
   If the board cannot reach agreement, however, one possibility,
say observers, is for it to name a director as chairman, with the
chief executive title going to Mr. Golub. Such a split recently took
effect at General Motors Corp. The likely board candidate is
believed to be Mr. Byrne, a strong advocate of getting value for
shareholders who also is close to Warren Buffett, a major American
Express investor.

@  More Firms Are Changing Names
@  To Better Suit the Changing Times

<p>
   What's in a name? Sometimes too much, sometimes not enough.
</p>
<p>
   Last year, the number of publicly traded companies that changed
their corporate monikers jumped to 107 from 83 the previous year,
according to a study scheduled for release today by Schechter Group,
a New York corporate and brand-identity consulting firm.
</p>
<p>
   A corporate name is as important as a brand name to Madison
Avenue, particularly when the company logo appears in commercials
and print ads. And industry executives say consumers are looking for
companies they can identify with; thus, fancy or stuffy names are
decidedly out. So, it appears, are names that associate a company
too closely with a controversial product such as tobacco, or names
that give no clue about a company's business.
</p>
<p>
   "Names are vitally important to advertising because entire
campaigns are sometimes based on corporate names," says Joseph
Smith, chairman of the New York consulting firm Oxtoby-Smith.
</p>
<p>
   The worst name change for last year, says Alvin Schechter,
chairman of the consulting firm that bears his name, resulted from
the merger between Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and Chemical Banking
Corp. The merged entities kept the Chemical name. "Both names were
terrible," he says. "Chemical is an unfriendly term and
Manufacturers's name was long and awkward."
</p>
<p>
   The companies fumbled a chance to promote the partnership with a
totally new name in the merger, says Mr. Schechter.
</p>
<p>
   A spokesman for Chemical says the two companies tried several
combinations of the names, but couldn't come up with anything they
liked better. An entirely new name was never considered because,
through advertising, each name had strong identity among consumers.
Finally, Chemical was retained because it had more branches.
</p>
<p>
   Other name changes "reflect the restructuring and focus on core
businesses that many publicly traded companies went through during
the recession," says Mr. Schechter.
</p>
<p>
   Still other companies changed names that no longer sounded
politically correct. PepsiCo's Kentucky Fried Chicken unit, one of
Mr. Schechter's clients, worried that urging people to eat anything
fried wasn't the best message to convey in the health-conscious
1990s.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Schechter hatched an idea: Drop the name entirely, use the
initials KFC and enlarge the image of Col. Sanders, the fast food
chain's icon, in advertising and on packaging. And the jingle,
"Kentucky Fried Chicken, we do chicken right," was re-recorded to,
"We are KFC, we do chicken right."
</p>
<p>
   In September, Horizon Gold Corp. changed its name to Horizon
Resources Corp. The word "gold" had lost its luster among investors
because of falling prices. A spokesman for the Golden, Colo.,
company says Horizon made the shift because it now mines potash
also.
</p>
<p>
   Some companies finally decide that less is more. American
Southwest Mortgage Investments Corp., in Tucson, Ariz., simplified
its name in June to ASR Investments Corp., saying the original was
just too much of a mouthful. Mr. Schecter notes that the use of
initials is also a way to "disguise" a company's nature and
guarantee anonymity.
</p>
<p>
   For example, Gulf Resources/Chemical last year deep-sixed that
name in favor of the less revealing Gulf USA Corp. The word
"chemical," says Mr. Schechter, doesn't convey an environmentally
sound message.
</p>
<p>
   In years past, companies changed their names to adapt to social
trends, says Mr. Schechter. Universal Leaf Tobacco in Richmond, Va.,
snuffed out its old name in 1990 in favor of Universal Corp. The
switch was made because the company had acquired non-tobacco
businesses, says a spokesman. The company shed some of those
unrelated businesses recently, but says it won't adopt its old
signature. "We're still not exclusively a tobacco company," says the
spokesman.
</p>
<p>
   Often, companies change their names to reflect dramatic changes
in their business or to focus attention on a star asset. In 1989,
for example, Gulf & Western Inc. changed its name to Paramount
Communications Inc.; the original name came from the company's
origins as a conglomerate in a hodge-podge of industrial operations.
After it shed most of those busineses to focus on entertainment and
publishing, the company decided to adopt the name of its largest
business, Paramount Pictures.
</p>
<p>
   The Schechter Group also tracked which companies are most likely
to change their names. Between 1987 and 1991, for example, 74
financial institutions switched monikers, and 64% of those dropped
the words "savings" and "loan," partly reflecting the S&L scandals
of the late 1980s and partly mirroring the blizzard of mergers and
acquisitions.
</p>
<p>
   But last year, one institution actually reversed the trend: Excel
Bancorp became Quincy Savings Bank. The change, says a spokesman of
the bank, based in Quincy, Mass., reflected a reorganization of its
holding company. Quincy Savings Bank had been used since 1845, and
the company wanted to go with a name long familiar to depositors.

   McCaffrey Loses Account
@
</p>
<p>
   Tiffany & Co., New York, moved its prestigious retail advertising
account from McCaffrey & McCall, New York, and consolidated an
estimated $20 million in world-wide advertising with
McCann-Erickson, New York.
</p>
<p>
   McCaffrey, which had handled Tiffany's estimated $10 million U.S.
account since 1986, holds onto the small corporate, or
business-to-business, portion of the account; exact billings
couldn't be determined. The loss is a tough blow to the agency,
badly shaken by the loss of the Mercedes-Benz account last year.
</p>
<p>
   Diana Lyne, Tiffany's senior vice president of marketing, said
Tiffany decided to move the retail account from McCaffrey because
"we think we need a truly international advertising agency to deal
with our growing international presence." McCaffrey has offices in
New York, Indianapolis and Toronto; it doesn't have any in Europe or
Asia.
</p>
<p>
   McCann-Erickson's Japan operations, McCann-Erickson Hakuhodo,
previously handled Tiffany advertising in Asia and the Far East.
Tiffany said it plans to keep the media portion of its account
in-house.

   Mobil Corp. tapped Minneapolis agency Fallon McElligott,
Minneapolis, for its Hefty trash bag account, industry executives
said.
</p>
<p>
   The account was previously handled by Wells Rich Greene BDDP, New
York, the agency responsible for the "Hefty Hefty Hefty, Wimpy Wimpy
Wimpy" slogan.
</p>
<p>
   Fallon, a unit of WPP Group, beat out three other contenders,
including the Chicago office of Omnicom Group's DDB Needham; Jordan

@  Clinton Is Close to Naming Key Aides
@  For Economic and Foreign Policy Posts
@  ----
@  By Gerald F. Seib and Michael K. Frisby
@  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<DD> 01/05/93 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16 </SO>
<TXT>
<p>
   President-elect Clinton is close to filling some sensitive
subcabinet jobs in foreign policy and economics, and has scheduled a
meeting with top aides this week to begin making decisions on
economic policy.
</p>
<p>
   Though he fulfilled his promise to finish naming his cabinet by
Christmas, Mr. Clinton has named only a few of his selections for
the second tier of advisers, many of which wield substantial power
in running the day-to-day operations of government agencies.
</p>
<p>
   For instance, Mr. Clinton is expected to name Peter Tarnoff,
president of the Council on Foreign Relations, to the influential
post of undersecretary of state for political affairs. That job is
the third-ranking post in the State Department, beneath the
secretary of state and his deputy, and traditionally is filled by a
career foreign-service officer who has broad responsibilities for
overseeing the daily work of the U.S. diplomatic corps.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Tarnoff was a career foreign service officer from 1961 until
1982. Like Secretary of State-designate Warren Christopher, Mr.
Tarnoff worked as a top State Department aide in the Carter
administration.
</p>
<p>
   Another potential choice for a top position in the State
Department is Democratic lawyer and consultant Tom Donilon, who also
could get a senior job in the White House. Mr. Donilon is close to
Mr. Christopher and practices in Mr. Christopher's law firm.
</p>
<p>
   In the trade area, the Clinton transition team has put together a
list of about 20 candidates to fill three slots for deputy U.S.
trade representatives plus the general counsel for the trade
representative's office. Among those under consideration, said
people familiar with the deliberations, are Michael Wessel, a trade
adviser to House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.); Barry
Carter, who heads the transition team's trade efforts; and Rufus
Yerxa, the current deputy trade representative to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
</p>
<p>
   Trade remains one of the most contentious issues for the new
administration, with Democrats split between free traders and those
who favor more managed trade. Indeed, it isn't clear who will make
trade policy, given that the nominee for the top slot, Mickey
Kantor, has no experience in international trade issues. Some of the
people being considered for positions in his office are also being
considered for trade positions in the National Economic Council,
which will be headed by Robert Rubin.
</p>
<p>
   Yesterday, Clinton transition officials were calling trade
experts to try to find the names of more blacks and Hispanics to
consider for trade positions.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Clinton is also believed to be sorting out his White House
staff this week. A host of aides, including Communications Director
George Stephanopoulos and transition official Mark Gearan, as well
as Democratic consultants Paul Begala and Mr. Donilon, could play
important roles in the White House. Their duties haven't been
decided, though Mr. Stephanopoulos is expected to remain in
communications.
</p>
<p>
   For the job of assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, New
York attorney Bernard Aidinoff is being given careful consideration
by the Clinton camp, according to Democratic sources. Mr. Aidinoff,
who is with the firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, was chairman of the
American Bar Association's tax section in the early 1980s and has
been a member of an advisory panel to the commissioner of the
Internal Revenue Service.
</p>
<p>
   People familiar with Mr. Aidinoff say he may be an appealing
choice for the new administration because he will be 64 and probably
wouldn't return to practicing law after government service. That
means he wouldn't have any problem adhering to the five-year
lobbying ban that Mr. Clinton has imposed on his top aides.
</p>
<p>
   Among the other possible candidates for the Treasury tax post is
Hank Gutman, the chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee
on Taxation and a former Treasury official.
</p>
<p>
   For the Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Clinton is expected to
name Alan Blinder, an economist at Princeton University, to serve on
the three-member panel. Mr. Blinder went to graduate school at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology with Laura Tyson, the
University of California economist who is to be chairman of the
council.
</p>
<p>
   As the Clinton transition continues to fill positions, finding
jobs for former campaign officials has become a challenge. Some
campaign workers have been told they will probably get six-month
appointments at various agencies, which would give them time to
become familiar with the government and find a permanent post.
</p>
<p>
   One campaign official slated for a job is New York attorney Kevin
Thurm, who is expected to be named chief of staff to Health and
Human Services Secretary-designate Donna Shalala. Mr. Thurm was New
York state director for the Clinton campaign and an Oxford classmate
of Mr. Stephanopoulos, suggesting that the White House will have
direct influence in the operation of HHS.
</p>
<p>
   Also at HHS, defeated New York Rep. Thomas Downey is under
consideration for a new position as deputy for human services. And
Stuart Altman, a Clinton campaign adviser and transition official,
is being considered for a post that would direct health services at
the department.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Clinton also will be turning this week to the task of setting
his economic policies more firmly. Mr. Stephanopoulos said Mr.
Clinton's economic appointees will gather in Little Rock with the
president-elect on Thursday. At the meeting, Mr. Clinton and his
advisers will discuss the hard choices on spending that must be made
to implement his programs while also cutting the budget deficit.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Stephanopoulos said the Clinton team will be reviewing
estimates of the federal deficit. The Clinton team wants to get "a
final fix on it. I mean, it's a moving number all of the time," Mr.
Stephanopoulos said. He added that Mr. Clinton will be talking with
his advisers by telephone as he prepares for the Thursday meeting.

<HL>    IBM Is Top Company for Developing
@  Global Executives, Harvard Survey Says
@  ----

@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>

<TXT>
<p>
   International Business Machines Corp. ranks as the world's most
highly regarded company in developing international executives,
concludes a new Harvard University survey of 929 senior executives
in 30 countries.
</p>
<p>
   IBM officials attribute the ranking to the personal involvement
of Chairman Louis V. Gerstner in top managers' career development as
well as the company's heavy reliance on foreign nationals for
overseas posts. Surveyed executives said both efforts will become
more common among companies committed to grooming global managers.
</p>
<p>
   The Harvard study, apparently unique in its broad scope, was
sponsored by Amrop International, an international partnership of
executive recruiters, and is set for release next week. Those polled
work for more than 500 different companies around the world.
</p>
<p>
   In the survey, four other big multinational concerns ranked just
after IBM in developing their international executives: Royal
Dutch/Shell Group; Unilever PLC; Procter & Gamble Co. and ABB Asea
Brown Boveri AG.
</p>
<p>
   Though 94% of surveyed executives said developing international
executives was vitally important to their businesses, only 46%
termed their companies successful in filling international executive
jobs. "These executives are saying that if they don't find better
ways to develop global executives, they will be handicapped" and
perhaps beaten by their competition, said C. Douglas Caldwell, vice
chairman of Amrop International and chairman of Caldwell Partners, a
search firm in Toronto.
</p>
<p>
   "Those companies whose CEOs are actively involved in executive
career development report greater success internationally than those
whose CEOs are not," the Harvard report said. IBM, for example, gets
more than 50% of its business from outside the U.S. Mr. Gerstner,
the new chief executive, imitates his predecessor John Akers by
annually reviewing detailed career development plans for the
computer concern's 1,500 senior managers, Gerald Czarnecki, senior
vice president of human resources and administration, said in an
interview.
</p>
<p>
   The review includes checking whether "executives are given
opportunities to gain international experience," Mr. Czarnecki
added. About 15% to 20% of these top executives have worked abroad
and that proportion "will keep going up," he said.
</p>
<p>
   To improve a company's batting average in this area, 69% of the
survey respondents said their chief executive officer will formulate
strategies for international career development within five years --
up from the 38% today. Polled executives predicted similarly large
gains in the CEO's expected involvement in hiring, assigning and
assuring promotions of successful international executives.
</p>
<p>
   "I always have and will continue to drive the issue of
multinational experience for executives," said Stephen Kaufman,
president and CEO of Arrow Electronics Inc., a big distributor of
electronic components in Melville, N.Y. "I consider that a prime
role" of a CEO, he added. Arrow has 5,000 employees world-wide,
including 1,600 in Europe.
</p>
<p>
   The Harvard study also detected a shift away from big companies'
traditional practice of sending executives overseas from their
headquarters. More than half of those surveyed now transfer people
abroad from the company's home country -- but just 34% expect to do
so in the future. Instead, 74% said they will recruit more foreign
nationals, up from 45% today.
</p>
<p>
   IBM also is altering its strategies for developing international
managerial talent, Mr. Czarnecki disclosed. Only a handful of the 25
or 30 IBM executives with global reponsibilities now come from
countries other than the U.S., he noted. "We want to increase the
involvement of more senior management from outside the U.S.," he
continued. He said IBM intends to do this by bringing more foreign
executives here for assignments at headquarters or at operating
divisions.

<HL>    Birthdays, Not Assets, Tip Off Bank Mergers
@  ----
@  By Steven Lipin
@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<DD> 11/16/93 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C1 </SO>

<p>
   Searching for the next big bank merger?
</p>
<p>
   Forget assets.
</p>
<p>
   Forget return on equity.
</p>
<p>
   Forget earnings.
</p>
<p>
   Just look for an aging chief executive officer.
</p>
<p>
   More so than in any other industry bank executives have wide
latitude to choose with whom they will or won't link up. Regulatory
issues virtually preclude hostile takeovers, and big egos are a bar
to mergers between banks headed by young and aggressive chief
executives.
</p>
<p>
   The result has been an increasing number of mergers between banks
in which at least one partner is headed by a chief executive
destined to retire soon. And there probably are going to be more.
</p>
<p>
   "A company with a strong chairman approaching retirement age,
without clearly visible succession, potentially can be a candidate
for a merger or sale," says John Leonard, banking analyst at Salomon
Brothers who examined recent mergers and concluded there is a clear
link between mergers and aging executives.
</p>
<p>
   Other bank experts agree. "When people ask us the next deals, one
of the things we look at is the CEO's age," said James Marx, editor
of Bank Mergers & Acquisitions newsletter. "A lot of deals,
especially thrifts, are being done because managers wish to cash out
before retiring."
</p>
<p>
   In KeyCorp's recent merger agreement with Society Corp., KeyCorp
Chairman Victor Riley, who is 62 years old, had no successor, and
Society Chairman Robert Gillespie is just 49. Although KeyCorp
officials concede that the succession issue was one reason the
merger was sought, they deny it was the driving force behind the
linkup with Society.
</p>
<p>
   And there were other potential suitors. John McCoy, the
acquisitive chairman of Banc One Corp. in Columbus, Ohio, wrote Mr.
Riley expressing interest in a deal during the Key-Society
discussions, but KeyCorp shrugged off Banc One's offer to talk. That
likely would have meant an acquisition by the larger Banc One.
</p>
<p>
   "Just because Victor Riley was nearing retirement doesn't mean
KeyCorp was," says Lee Irving, Key's treasurer.
</p>
<p>
   Pending retirements apparently have contributed to other deals.
Analysts point to Boatmen's Bancshares Inc.'s purchase of SunWest
Financial Corp., First Bank System Inc.'s acquisition of Colorado
National Bancshares and a couple of recent acquisitions by First
Fidelity Bancorp. as examples of deals struck in part because of the
age of the target's chief executive.
</p>
<p>
   Those banks either wouldn't comment or didn't return calls, but
other bankers concede that age is a factor in deals. "In theory, it
should not be a factor," says Richard Kovasevich, chief executive of
Norwest Corp., Minneapolis. "But in practice, it absolutely does
play a role."
</p>
<p>
   And Banc One's Mr. McCoy acknowledges that young bank executives
are loath to give up their positions in a merger. "Once you have the
golden ring, it's hard to let go," he says, adding that "there's so
much energy wasted on the politics of who's going to be the chief
executive or chief financial officer, who gets what job and is it
fair."
</p>
<p>
   Analysts and investors say First Chicago Corp. and First
Interstate Bancorp could be considered retirement plays in the near
term. And they suggest that in a few years, Bank of New York Co.
could become a retirement play.
</p>
<p>
   Harrumph, say the banks.
</p>
<p>
   "He's not that old," protests a spokeswoman for Richard Thomas,
First Chicago's 62-year-old chairman. And yesterday's announcement
that Mr. Thomas picked a president -- and heir apparent -- reduces
the chances of a succession play.
</p>
<p>
   A spokesman for Edward Carson, the 63-year-old chairman of First
Interstate, pointedly notes that there's a long history of in-house
succession. Ditto for Bank of New York, says a spokesman for
60-year-old Chairman J. Carter Bacot.
</p>
<p>
   Lest you take all this too seriously, note that picking the next
bank merger on any basis isn't necessarily a rewarding pastime.
Although many banks' shares also have slipped in price, since
KeyCorp's merger with Society was announced, KeyCorp's shares have
fallen 12.6% to $34.50.

<HL>    Management:
@  Many Firms Seeking New Chiefs
@  Don't Look Beyond Boardroom
@  ----
@  By Joann S. Lublin
@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<DD> 10/28/93 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1 </SO>
<TXT>
<p>
   Executives yearning for the top jobs at their companies
increasingly face unforeseen competitors: outside directors.
</p>
<p>
   Board seats have become steppingstones to top jobs in recent
months. The trend reflects a growing number of boardroom coups,
greater demand for independent directors with good business skills
and boards' increased willingness to look outside current management
for new talent.
</p>
<p>
   Six of the 51 new chief executives chosen by major industrial
companies during the first half of 1993 previously had been outside
directors at those businesses, says Eugene Jennings, a board
consultant and Michigan State University emeritus professor of
management. That figure nearly equals the seven such appointments in
all of 1992 -- and portends a record high for the year, he notes.
"We seem to be using boards more as a training ground for our future
chiefs."
</p>
<p>
   Fresh examples keep popping up. Last week, FHP International
Corp., a managed-care and insurance concern, named an outside
director co-chief executive and president. In August,
aerospace-materials maker Hexcel Corp. tapped two outside board
members to be co-chief executives. And in July, Giddings & Lewis
Inc., a big machine-tool manufacturer, replaced its chairman and CEO
with a board outsider.
</p>
<p>
   At the same time, some headhunters say corporate clients have
begun to demand outside directors with the potential to succeed the
companies' chief executives. New York recruiter E. Pendleton James
received his first such assignment two years ago -- and has since
filled similar board slots for two other companies.
</p>
<p>
   However, most boards crowning a fellow member act out of crisis.
At Hexcel, a defense contractor hurt by military spending cutbacks,
directors ousted Robert L. Witt, the company chairman and chief
executive, last summer after objecting to the way he was
restructuring the company.
</p>
<p>
   Donald J. O'Mara, the concern's president and chief operating
officer, lacked enough experience to replace Mr. Witt, board members
say. But Hexcel "could ill afford to spend two or three months
trying to find the right person" from outside because it already was
"in default on its loan agreement," recalls John J. Lee, an investor
and outside director. "You can't put an unstable business into
suspended animation while you go find someone to come and run it,"
he emphasizes.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Lee says he and another outside director, John L. Doyle,
proposed that they jointly run Hexcel after the board split over
which of the two should be the new CEO. Mr. Lee also became
chairman. Last month, Hexcel expanded its restructuring efforts by
announcing a third-quarter charge of $50 million, new layoffs and
plans to cut capacity.
</p>
<p>
   Outside directors who become chief executives say their board
experience greatly shortened their learning curve once they took
charge. "I've probably made a number of changes more quickly than I
otherwise would have done," observes Randall Tobias, the new
chairman and CEO of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly & Co. A Lilly
outside director since 1986, he previously was a vice chairman of
American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Tobias met with Wall Street securities analysts on July 20,
just three weeks after he assumed command of Lilly, which has
recently suffered disappointing earnings and other setbacks. "I'm
not sure I would have had the confidence to do that if I hadn't come
to Lilly knowing the people and the situation," the 51-year-old
chief executive says. This month, Mr. Tobias unveiled plans to
broadly shake up the once-staid drug maker, starting with 4,000 job
cuts through early retirements and reassignments.
</p>
<p>
   At Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., outside director Stanley Gault was
named chairman and CEO in 1991 and led the rejuvenation of the
company. The impact of Mr. Gault, who had previously retired as
chairman of Rubbermaid Inc., "has been reflected on the bottom line
in a very short period of time -- and very dramatically," says G.G.
Michelson, a Goodyear outside director.
</p>
<p>
   But in some cases, an outside director's links with prior
management raise doubts about his or her independence as new CEO.
The issue arose last summer when Jeffrey C. Barbakow became chairman
and CEO of National Medical Enterprises Inc. after co-founders
Richard K. Eamer and Leonard Cohen resigned under pressure from the
beleaguered hospital chain. Mr. Barbakow, an outside board member
since 1990, is a longtime friend of Mr. Eamer's. As a managing
director of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Mr. Barbakow also was an
investment banker for National Medical.
</p>
<p>
   Todd Richter, an analyst at Dean Witter, Discover & Co.,
initially worried that Mr. Barbakow might be an Eamer puppet because
he "does have a tie to the management team that got the company in
trouble in the first place." The U.S. government has launched a
criminal investigation of National Medical, and insurers have sued
the company for allegedly filing fraudulent claims.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Barbakow overcame analysts' fears by distancing himself from
his predecessor. "I am not worried about that question mark" of the
Eamer friendship, he insists. "The record speaks for itself. We are
trying to make the right decisions."
</p>
<p>
   Transplants from the boardroom to the executive suite don't
always work out. This month, Lawrence Gordon abruptly stepped down
as chief operating officer of Domino's Pizza Inc., a post he had
held since January. He departed about a year after joining the
Domino's board. The 71-year-old turnaround specialist says Thomas S.
Monaghan, Domino's founder and CEO, fired him one Saturday afternoon
while he was home alone, watching a televised football game. Mr.
Monaghan "felt there were differences in our methodology and that he
would like to end the relationship," Mr. Gordon recollects with
dismay.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Monaghan disagrees with that account. Mr. Gordon's "work in
spearheading the financial restructuring of Domino's was largely
completed," a spokesman says. "Tom wished him well and felt he did a
good job."

@  Corporate Chiefs Polish Their Relations With Directors

<p>
   High anxiety grips America's executive suites these days as a
record number of chief executive officers topple from power.
</p>
<p>
   Since 1991, two dozen CEOs of major U.S. corporations -- from
American Express Co. to Westinghouse Electric Corp. -- have been
forced out by activist boards. Leaders no longer can depend on
handpicked board allies for their job security. "I feel like I've
been stripped of my office by a bunch of turncoats," declared Carl
Karcher, founder of Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc., after a board
primarily made up of his longtime friends ousted him this month as
chairman of the fast-food chain in Anaheim, Calif.
</p>
<p>
   Now, more corporate chiefs are trying to fortify their chances of
survival by significantly revamping their dealings with directors.
Some are involving independent board members more in running the
day-to-day business. Other CEOs are asking boards for rigorous and
formal evaluations of their performance. A few company heads even
engage outside consultants to smooth their dealings with directors.
Or they try to forge closer ties with powerful board members.
</p>
<p>
   Even executives who appear secure in their jobs are going the
extra mile. Consider Irving W. Bailey II, chairman and CEO of
Capital Holding Corp., a big insurance and consumer-finance concern
in Louisville, Ky. Last winter, Mr. Bailey says he traveled to five
U.S. cities to brainstorm with directors about ways to improve
selection of new board members and other corporate-governance
issues. CEOs have rarely conducted such hand holding outside a
crisis situation, management experts say.
</p>
<p>
   John Nash, president of the National Association of Corporate
Directors in Washington, agrees. "In the past, CEOs treated boards
like mushrooms," he says. "They kept them in the dark and fed them
manure."
</p>
<p>
   Poor board chemistry played a greater role than poor financial
results in the recent departure of several prominent CEOs. Last
April, for instance, directors of Giddings & Lewis Inc. demanded the
resignation of William J. Fife, its chairman and chief executive,
even though he had transformed the formerly cash-starved concern
into a successful maker of factory machines. Board members said Mr.
Fife had begun to treat Giddings as if it were his own. Executives
cited his abrasive management approach. At the time of his
departure, Mr. Fife cited Giddings's strong earnings growth. He
declines to comment further.
</p>
<p>
   Bernard Marcus, chairman and chief executive of Home Depot Inc.,
a major home-improvement chain, believes more CEOs may get pushed
out if they fail to involve board members in day-to-day business.
Directors of the Atlanta company must make unannounced visits to
between eight and 10 Home Depot stores every quarter. After walking
around a store and chatting anonymously with customers, a director
divulges his or her identity in order to hear workers' gripes.
</p>
<p>
   The requirement, extended to outside directors in 1991, enables
the chain to learn quickly about dirty floors, difficult customers,
inadequate employee training and other store problems. Equally
important, Mr. Marcus says, "you are now dealing with members of the
board who absolutely know and understand your business."
</p>
<p>
   Directors' first-hand knowledge also buttresses Mr. Marcus's job
security, some suggest. The store visits are part of Home Depot's
highly open corporate culture that "says there won't be any board
surprises or board overthrows" of the chief executive, says Faye
Wilson, a Home Depot director and BankAmerica Corp. executive vice
president.
</p>
<p>
   An extensive performance evaluation is another increasingly
popular device that some chief executives use to lengthen their
tenure. In 1989, only 14% of 644 companies systematically evaluated
their CEO's performance, concluded a survey by consultants Sibson &
Co. "That figure probably has at least doubled" since then, says
Craig Schneier, a management consultant in Princeton, N.J., who
conducted the Sibson study.
</p>
<p>
   Thomas Gossage, chairman and chief executive of Hercules Inc.,
negotiated his first written "accountability" list last spring with
the board of the Wilmington, Del., chemical and aerospace company.
He proposed five areas of accountability, including earnings
improvement, reduction in the number of worker injuries, increased
community awareness of Hercules's antipollution efforts and a shift
in the company's mix of businesses.
</p>
<p>
   Directors weren't satisfied. They asked Mr. Gossage to toughen
certain goals. Mr. Gossage says directors asked him to draw up a
strategic road map and goals for the year 2000; he had proposed to
reach a certain return on shareholder equity by 1995.
</p>
<p>
   In December, a board committee will evaluate Mr. Gossage against
his checklist. He thinks the process enhances his job security.
Directors "can't come out of left field and say, `You aren't doing
what we want you to do,' because we have a contract that we
negotiate every year," he says. "To that extent I am at less risk
than I would have been if I wasn't having that kind of dialogue with
the board."
</p>
<p>
   Other leaders hope to prolong their reigns by getting expert
advice on handling directors. "In this environment, you have to take
a more personal role" in dealing with a board, says the president
and CEO of a Midwestern producer of paper and plastics. Soon after
he became president last fall, a few directors encouraged him to see
an executive coach.
</p>
<p>
   Dee Soder in New York counseled him for four months. He says he
learned, among other things, the importance of building coalitions
with key directors as well as understanding individual members'
private agendas. In May, the board promoted him to CEO.
</p>
<p>
   A growing number of chief executives use another type of hired
gun: the National Association of Corporate Directors. The NACD
charges $25,000 to play troubleshooter when a CEO's relations with
directors sour. Businesses currently summon the group a dozen times
a year -- up from twice a year about three years ago, officials
report.
</p>
<p>
   Last fall, the association helped save the head of a successful
billion-dollar maker of business supplies. Board members were "very,
very unhappy" because the chief executive told them so little,
recalls the NACD's Mr. Nash. Several directors threatened to resign
during a two-day board retreat organized by Mr. Nash at the
corporation's headquarters in Seattle. He says he finally persuaded
the CEO to reform or ultimately face dismissal. Today, the top
executive holds regular strategic-planning sessions with directors
-- and even returns their calls.
</p>
<p>
   Such survival attempts don't always succeed. Last January,
Eastman Kodak Co. announced that Kaye Whitmore, then chairman and
chief executive, had formed a special board panel to work with
senior management and improve communication with outside directors.
But people close to Kodak now say it was the board that created the
committee to oversee Mr. Whitmore and prod him to make massive cost
cuts. In any case, the idea didn't work. Directors disliked his
turnaround plan. Mr. Whitmore wouldn't comment. In August, the board
ousted him.

   Eastco Industrial Safety Corp., Huntington Station, N.Y., said it
expects to post a loss for fiscal 1993 and "disappointing" results
for fiscal first quarter of 1994.
</p>
<p>
   The maker and distributor of industrial safety products said its
president and chief executive officer stepped down.
</p>
<p>
   Joel Poznansky, 35 years old, who joined the company in July as
vice president of manufacturing, was named president and chief
executive officer, succeeding Alan E. Densen, 60, who became senior
vice president. Mr. Densen will continue as a director and chairman.
</p>
<p>
   Eastco said it's likely the company will report a loss for fiscal
1994, which ends in June. It attributed the poor performance to
"weak industry conditions and a shortage of working capital."
</p>
<p>
   In order to improve its working capital, Eastco extended its
credit arrangements with its principal lender by another year, and
the senior management collectively loaned $250,000 to the company,
an amount which was matched by the bank. The company, which employs
about 200 people, said it's implementing a series of cost-cutting
measures, including layoffs.

@  To Higher Pay

<p>
   Compensation for 200 of the highest-paid chief financial officers
jumped an average 25% last year as corporations recognized their
broader talents and moved to keep the headhunters at bay.
</p>
<p>
   Their pay on average was $458,636, up from $366,332, according to
a new survey, to be published this week by Global Finance magazine.
The report is based on public filings from 1,500 of the nation's
largest corporations that list the five highest-paid executives in
each company. Salary, cash bonuses, profit-sharing and certain
perquisites are included in the $458,636 figure, but not options
exercised and restricted stock granted.
</p>
<p>
   As the role of chief financial officer has evolved in recent
years "from numbers-cruncher to strategic planner," says Carl
Burgen, editor in chief of the specialty publication, "companies are
considering CFOs a critical component of top management -- and are
paying them accordingly."
</p>
<p>
   To be sure, the average chief financial officer didn't enjoy such
a hefty increase. In fact, average salary and bonus held steady for
chief financial officers at 400 of the nation's largest industrial
corporations in 1992, according to Hewitt Associates, Lincolnshire,
Ill., a compensation consulting firm. The reason for the discrepancy
between the two surveys: By relying on proxies detailing companies'
five best-compensated executives, Global Finance is starting with
chief financial officers who are, by definition, outstanding
performers and tend to get big raises.
</p>
<p>
   Holding first place in the Global Finance survey is James
Cunnane, chief financial officer of defense contractor General
Dynamics Corp. In 1992, Mr. Cunnane, 55 years old, took home more
than $3 million in salary and bonuses. The bonuses were linked to a
320% increase in the stock's value between 1991 and 1992, a
spokesman says. The compensation represented a 535% boost over Mr.
Cunnane's 1991 pay.
</p>
<p>
   In second-place is Rollin Dick, chief financial officer of
Conseco Inc., a Carmel, Ind., insurance holding company. Mr. Dick,
60, got a 91% pay increase in 1992, earning just above $2 million. A
Conseco spokesman noted that 1992 operating earnings-per-share was
up 79%.
</p>
<p>
   The Global Finance survey, conducted by Investors' Fiduciary
Services in Atlanta, puts the median 1992 pay at $379,686, an
increase of 16.8%. The fact that the median -- the middle figure in
a list from highest to lowest -- is lower than the average suggests
that the average is skewed by big salaries at the top of the list.
Still, by eliminating the three highest and lowest salaries from the
calculations, the average pay drops only to $450,599, a 24.6% annual
boost.
</p>
<p>
   Several chief financial officers enjoying big pay raises have
gained added titles and responsibilities. James Dimon, Chief
Financial Officer of Primerica Corp. since 1986, saw his pay jump
20%, to $1.3 million, as the 37-year-old also became the
financial-services company's president. At Marion Merrell Dow Inc.,
chief financial officer Edward Mehrer, 54, also became chief
administrative officer. His pay climbed 36%, to $688,335.
</p>
<p>
   As demand has increased over the past several years for
experienced cost-cutting executives, many companies with
battle-tested finance chiefs have begun to reward them more
generously "to make sure the CFO doesn't leave," says James Woodrum,
an executive compensation consultant with Hewitt Associates.
</p>
<p>
   "For CFOs of a certain stature, there is something approaching a
bidding war for their services by companies who really need that
cost-cutting expertise," Mr. Woodrum says.
</p>
<p>
   Windle Priem, an executive recruiter with Korn/Ferry
International, adds, "With all the massive restructurings and
repositionings, this is the age of the CFO." Some chief financial
officers recruited recently are earning 40% more than predecessors,
he says.
</p>
<p>
   By relying on proxy filings, the Global Finance study may well
understate the pay of the nation's elite chief financial officers.
In many of the largest corporations, wellpaid divisional chiefs edge
out chief financial officers for spots on the proxy list of the five
highest-compensated individuals; still, those chief financial
officers actually are paid much more than some of their counterparts
at other corporations who do make the proxy list.
</p>
<p>
   The rise in pay of chief financial officers is even more
impressive when exercised stock options and restricted stock grants
are taken into consideration, the survey indicates. Average
compensation soars to $945,532, up 40% from 1991. A big reason for
the jump: Chief financial officers joined the executive rush to
exercise stock options before Congress could levy heavier personal
taxes.

<p>
   In his first major management move since taking the
helm of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Chairman Arthur
Levitt consolidated control of the SEC's 12 regional and branch
offices under five regional directors.
</p>
<p>
   All five regional directors will report to William McLucas, head
of the SEC's enforcement division in Washington. In the past, the
administrators of the SEC's regional offices have shared equal
ranking and reported directly to the chairman of the SEC.
</p>
<p>
   Those promoted from regional administrator to the new regional
directorships are Elaine Cacheris of the Los Angeles office, to head
the Pacific region; Robert Davenport of Denver, to head the Central
region; William Goldsberry of Chicago, to head the Midwest region,
and Richard Walker of New York, to head the Northeastern region.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Levitt, who has been SEC chairman less than six weeks, didn't
immediately name a director for the Southeast region, covering the
SEC's regional office in Atlanta and its branch in Miami. He did say
in a statement that the regional base will shift to Miami from
Atlanta.
</p>
<p>
   Separately, Mr. Levitt appointed Donald Hoerl to fill the vacant
administrator's post in the SEC's Philadelphia office, which will be
part of the Northeast region. Mr. Hoerl, an 11-year veteran of the
SEC, spent the past six years as head of the SEC's branch office in
Salt Lake City and was previously chief trial counsel in the SEC's
Denver office.

<p>
   In the wake of a takeover by News Corp., the chief
executive officer of Star TV resigned after less than six months in
that post, industry executives said.
</p>
<p>
   Last week, News Corp. bought 63.6% of the satellite broadcaster,
which serves the entire Asian region, for $525 million in cash and
stock from Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and the family of Li Ka-shing.
</p>
<p>
   At the time of the purchase, News Corp. executives said they
would like the executive, Julian Mounter, to stay. However, Star's
chief balked at the prospect of not reporting directly to Rupert
Murdoch, News Corp.'s chairman and chief executive officer, people
close to Mr. Mounter said. Both Mr. Mounter and a Star spokesman
declined to comment.
</p>
<p>
   It is likely that Star's new chief executive will report to
either Sam Chisholm, chief executive of News Corp.'s U.K.-based
satellite broadcaster, British Sky Broadcasting, or Chase Carey,
chief operating officer of News Corp.'s Fox Inc. film and television
unit.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Mounter's departure is expected to be formally announced this
week.
</p>
<p>
   Although there are no obvious successors, it is expected that Mr.
Murdoch will choose someone from either British Sky Broadcasting or
Fox to run Star, said a person close to News Corp.

<p>
   President Clinton may have gotten off to a rocky
start in some ways, but you can't knock his courtesy.
</p>
<p>
   When Ron Kiczenski of Paso Robles, Calif., sent a package that he
says contained a quarter-pound of marijuana to Mr. Clinton, the
president was kind enough to reply with a thank-you note.
</p>
<p>
   "Thanks so much for writing," the form letter said. "I welcome
your thoughts and promise they will be carefully considered. I
appreciate your taking the time to let me know how you feel."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Kiczenski, 29 years old, says he sent the dope to the White
House, but not because he felt it was finally time for Mr. Clinton
to inhale. Though he admits to taking a toke or two to relax,
smoking marijuana, he says, is "about the last thing it's good for."
</p>
<p>
   He says he wants the drug legalized, not for recreational
purposes but for the economic value of hemp, the plant from which
marijuana is cultivated. Using hemp would help save other precious
natural resources, he argues. Hemp can be used to make a variety of
products, he adds, that now come from timber and petroleum
byproducts. To make his point, he sent the marijuana wrapped in
cloth made from hemp, and the accompanying letter was written on
paper made from hemp.
</p>
<p>
   The White House declined to respond to press inquiries about the
marijuana mail, but Mr. Kiczenksi says that in tape-recorded
telephone conversations he made with White House employees they
acknowledge receipt of the pot package.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Kiczenski, who wants to be arrested for mailing marijuana to
the president, hopes an arrest will generate the publicity he craves
for his cause. He has spoken with the Secret Service and Drug
Enforcement Administration agents, but so far they seem to have more
important things to do.
</p>
<p>
   He did get a nice letter from Mary Lee Warren, chief of the
Justice Department's narcotic and dangerous-drug section, thanking
him for his phone call "informing us of your shipment of marijuana
to President Clinton at the White House." Ms. Warren referred the
case to the DEA.
</p>
<p>
   He also got a letter from the chief of the forest service, who
responded to the advocacy of hemp byproducts by noting other
solutions to save trees. He also reminded Mr. Kiczenski that "the
cultivation of hemp is no longer legal."

<p>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. is expected to announce today
a high-level management reorganization, according to individuals
close to the company.
</p>
<p>
   They said AT&T Chairman Robert E. Allen has revamped AT&T's upper
ranks in the biggest management restructuring since AT&T's hostile
takeover of NCR Corp. two years ago and the company's restructuring
into business units in 1988.
</p>
<p>
   In addition, Mr. Allen will name Richard Miller, former chairman
of Wang Laboratories Inc., to be AT&T's new executive vice president
and chief financial officer. AT&T declined to comment on the
management changes, which were approved yesterday by directors and
become effective Aug. 1.
</p>
<p>
   The changes reflect Mr. Allen's desire to accelerate AT&T's
globalization and move into multimedia products and communications
services, insiders said. Mr. Allen has said he wants at least 50% of
AT&T's revenue to come from overseas from the current 25% by the end
of the decade, and he has begun installing country and regional
managers to build mini-AT&Ts to do just that in key markets such as
China and Spain.
</p>
<p>
   Now Mr. Allen has elevated AT&T's most senior executives and
expanded the management roles of several others as he continues this
quest. Some of the spade work for this expansion had already been
done by former vice chairman Randall Tobias, who recently left AT&T
to become the chairman of Eli Lilly and Co.
</p>
<p>
   Victor Pelson, group executive of AT&T's huge Communication
Services Group, will become executive vice president of AT&T in
charge of a newly formed seven-member Global Operations Team, said
one person familiar with the changes. Mr. Pelson, 56, will also
function as AT&T's chief operating officer and will be named to
AT&T's board, succeeding Mr. Tobias, he said.
</p>
<p>
   Similarly, William Marx, 54, group executive of AT&T's Network
Systems Group, has been named executive vice president. He will
retain his current duties as chief executive of Network Systems and
will pick up responsibility for world-wide purchasing at AT&T and
AT&T's global manufacturing planning.
</p>
<p>
   "The idea is to have regions stand on their own, a much better
geographic balance instead of running things out of Basking Ridge,
N.J.," one individual said. "Both Pelson and Marx will be jointly
responsible for accelerating AT&T's global expansion and will set up
regional and country leadership structure for our operations
overseas."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Allen also revised the responsibilities of three of AT&T's
top executives, managers whom some insiders regard as having the
greatest potential for succeeding Mr. Allen when he reaches
mandatory retirement in seven years. Mr. Allen, 58, who took over as
AT&T's chairman five years ago, has never named a president and has
said he hasn't any immediate plans to do so.
</p>
<p>
   Alex Mandl, AT&T's chief financial officer, was named to succeed
Mr. Pelson as head of Communications Services. A former chairman of
Sea-Land Services Inc., Mr. Mandl, 49, has wielded tremendous
influence over AT&T's financial management since Mr. Allen lured him
to the company two years ago.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Mandl has helped streamline AT&T's finances, developing and
enforcing new compensation packages for making the company more
profitable and competitive. He has also become AT&T's chief
negotiator on key strategic transactions, including AT&T's planned
$3.8 billion investment in McCaw Cellular Communications Co., the
nation's largest cellular phone company.
</p>
<p>
   Now, as an executive vice president, Mr. Mandl will head AT&T's
core long-distance services business, which accounts for more than
$40 billion of AT&T's $65 billion in annual revenue, as well as
other businesses such as wireless services and credit cards. "Bob
wants to give Alex an operating role at AT&T," said one insider.
</p>
<p>
   In addition, Robert M. Kavner, currently group executive of
AT&T's Communications Products Group, was made an executive vice
president. AT&T also expanded the scope of his group, renaming it
the Multimedia Products and Services Group. Mr. Kavner, 50, has been
AT&T's point man in computers, pushing the company's hostile
takeover of NCR and move into pocket data communicators and other
multimedia products. "Allen is determined not to miss opportunities
as communications, computing and entertainment are merging," said
one individual familiar with Mr. Kavner's new assignment.
</p>
<p>
   Jerre Stead, currently president of AT&T's NCR unit, was named an
executive vice president of AT&T. Named to his new assignment at NCR
only a few months ago, Mr. Stead, 50, a former chairman of Square D
Corp., will be asked to take a more active role in helping AT&T's
overseas expansion. "Since half of his operations are overseas he'll
work most closely with Pelson and Marx on the globalization effort
as well," an insider said.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Miller, a former chief financial officer of RCA Corp. who
moved to General Electric Co. after its takeover of RCA in 1986,
joined Wang in 1990 when the computer company was struggling to
reverse huge losses and pay off a cumbersome debt. An AT&T insider
said the 52-year-old Mr. Miller was chosen not only for his
financial acumen but also his background in consumer electronics.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Marx's elevation and new responsibilities outside the Network
Systems Group, required that Mr. Allen appoint a new president and
chief operating officer of the group's giant unit that builds
switching and transmission equipment for phone companies and
businesses. Promoted to president and chief operating officer at the
unit, also called AT&T Network Systems, is Richard McGuinn, 46, who
is currently senior vice president for marketing and strategic
planning at the unit.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Allen is also said to be eager to show lower-level, highly
regarded executives that AT&T is a big company that nonetheless
offers quick advancement. It's still unclear from today's
announcement what additional moves he will make, however.
</p>
<p>
   Some of the biggest changes may come in Mr. Mandl's new group,
the giant Communication Services. Said to be in line for a promotion
or new, more highly visible assignment is Joseph Nacchio, now
president of AT&T Business Communications Services, which posted
almost $20 billion in revenue last year.
</p>
<p>
   A combative marketer and major AT&T tactician, Mr. Nacchio kept
AT&T competitive in the business market against a relentless
marketing assault from MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp.
</p>
<p>
   Some insiders said Mr. Mandl may eventually ask Mr. Nacchio to do
the same for the similarly sized AT&T Consumer Communication
Services, now headed by Merrill Tutton. The Consumer unit's "i Plan"
for residential customers, which one analyst likened to the
inscrutable Infinity car ads of a few years ago, has failed to stem
losses of millions of customers to MCI's snappy "Friends & Family"
and Sprint's sleeper-hit "The Most."
</p>
<p>
   "Stay tuned," said one person familiar with AT&T's management
moves. "More changes are coming."

<HL>    Management:
@  Firms Use Contracts and Cash to Prevent
@  Talent Raids by Departing Executives
@  ----
@  By Julie Amparano Lopez
@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<DD> 07/09/93 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1 </SO>
<TXT>
<p>
   Infuriated by talent raids staged by departing executives, many
big companies are erecting elaborate new anti-defection defenses.
</p>
<p>
   The motive is self-preservation: Jobhopping executives can wreak
considerable havoc by recruiting trusted lieutenants. "It can be
terrible to lose one executive. But when several leave, a company
can be devastated," says Joseph Bachelder, a New York lawyer and
executive-pay specialist.
</p>
<p>
   To prevent that, a number of companies "are taking out their
golden handcuffs and anything else they can to chain top performers
to the wall," notes David B. Radden, a senior vice president with
recruiters Paul R. Ray & Co.
</p>
<p>
   At Compaq Computer Corp., for example, executives forfeit special
pension plans if they try to recruit talent when they leave.
American Express Co. has established employment agreements for many
executives that include noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements.
And Paine-Webber Group Inc.'s money-management unit, Mitchell
Hutchins Institutional Investors Inc., recently gave stars more
money to sign employment agreements, which tie them to the company
for at least 18 months.
</p>
<p>
   The Mitchell Hutchins contracts were drawn up after the company's
president, Stephen E. Canter, left in April to join Kleinwort Benson
Group PLC; nearly one-quarter of the portfolio managers followed,
and Mitchell Hutchins lost some important accounts.
</p>
<p>
   At General Motors Corp., new anti-defection defenses were
occasioned by the departure of J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, head
of GM's European purchasing operations; in March, Mr. Lopez bolted
for Volkswagen AG and took along seven key managers.
</p>
<p>
   In the aftermath of Mr. Lopez's departure and raid, GM
accelerated the implementation of a bonus plan that was first
developed last year. A special committee of GM outside directors now
determines how and when bonuses are awarded to about 500 top
managers. The committee can grant, say, 25% of an executive's bonus
at year end and the balance when he or she retires.
</p>
<p>
   GM officials decline to disclose specific amounts awarded so far.
But it is safe to say that managers who prematurely jump ship may
forfeit millions of dollars in bonuses. That makes it nearly
impossible for a former executive to recruit former colleagues, says
Judith Fischer, publisher of Executive Compensation Reports, a
newsletter in Fairfax Station, Va.
</p>
<p>
   Similarly, Micron Technology Inc. in Boise, Idaho, spreads out
its managers' annual bonuses over five years. The electronics maker
created the plan in 1985 to keep executives from job hopping. Any
executive who quits Micron before retirement loses the unawarded
portion of the bonus. Company officials say that the plan was
developed to keep talent motivated but it also helps to prevent a
brain drain.
</p>
<p>
   Talent raids are hardly new in corporate America. Lee Iacocca,
Chrysler Corp.'s retired chairman and chief executive officer, lured
dozens of Ford Motor Co. managers for many years after he left the
latter company in 1978. One of the most spectacular raiding cases
happened in 1988 at Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein, a major
advertising agency in New York. Half of the agency's management team
walked out the door one day, leaving no one in charge. The
executives, who included the chairman and president, set up a
competing agency across the street and unabashedly began wooing
other Lord Geller employees.
</p>
<p>
   But such raids seem to be occurring more frequently today,
largely because there is so much turmoil in corporate America. When
an outside manager gets hired to deal with such problems, "he
usually wants someone he has worked with in the past and someone he
can trust," says Jay Conger, a Harvard University associate business
professor. Also, Prof. Conger notes, executives are changing jobs
more often than they did 10 years ago.
</p>
<p>
   Some executives strongly believe they have a right to recruit.
When they are "racing against the clock" to fix ailing companies,
executives must find the best people to help, Mr. Iacocca says.
"Many times, that's at the company where you worked before. It makes
them really mad. But that's the way business is."
</p>
<p>
   Some companies find that intense negotiations and counteroffers
can stem a management exodus. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. feared for
the stability of its senior management when its chief executive
officer, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., took the helm of International
Business Machines Corp. in March and tried to take along RJR's chief
financial officer and general counsel. RJR used vice-chairman titles
and sweetened compensation to block the defections of Karl von der
Heyden, its chief financial officer at the time, and Lawrence
Ricciardi, its general counsel.
</p>
<p>
   RJR board members also personally spoke with Mr. Gerstner. He
finally decided not to take the two men -- apparently out of a
desire to maintain amicable relations, according to an IBM official.
But Mr. Gerstner did snatch David Kalis, RJR's senior vice president
of communications.
</p>
<p>
   Other corporations are attaching punitive "bad boy" clauses to
executives' compensation agreements. For instance, Compaq's chief
executive officer, Eckhard Pfeiffer, and four other top executives
could each lose millions in benefits and a special pension fund if
they recruit just one Compaq employee when they leave the
personal-computer maker. The company says it developed the
agreements last year to guard better against the recruiting and job
switches that are so prevalent in the computer and software
industries.
</p>
<p>
   "Companies are trying to make it as painful as possible for
former executives to steal employees," explains Alan M. Johnson, a
compensation consultant in New York. "The best way to do that is to
put a very significant amount of money on the table."
</p>
<p>
   Preventive measures work best. That is why IBM recently devised a
stock-options scheme to keep 1,200 top managers. The plan lets these
managers swap old stock options for new ones. Because of IBM's
depressed stock price, most of these old options can't currently be
exercised at a profit. Under the plan, the managers must wait two
years to exercise half of the options and another two years for the
remainder. IBM figures that the stock plan will prevent a talent
exodus.
</p>
<p>
   Such practices make it difficult for former executives to "pry
loose other managers," says Matt Ward, a lawyer with Wyatt Co., a
compensation consulting firm.
</p>
<p>
   Courts offer businesses little help when an executive does attack
management's ranks, however. In May, GM lost a German court fight to
ban Mr. Lopez from taking the seven managers to Volkswagen. GM had
claimed that its competitive position would be damaged if Volkswagen
hired them. PaineWebber withdrew a suit it had brought against Mr.
Canter last month after the concern failed to find that the Mitchell
Hutchins president had acted improperly.
</p>
<p>
   "It's very difficult to win these cases," says Felice Ekelman, a
compensation lawyer with Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler & Krupman, a New
York management-law firm. "The Constitution protects us from
slavery. People have a right to work where they want."

@  Mutual Fund CEOs
@  Find Industry Boom

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION </SO>
<DATELINE> NEW YORK </DATELINE>
<TXT>
<p>
   Last year's boom in the mutual fund industry was also
good for mutual fund chief executives' paychecks.
</p>
<p>
   A survey of 13 public fund company chief executives' total
compensation, compiled by New York newsletter Fund Action, found
that the median chief's pay increased 23%. The biggest gain, and
highest total compensation, went to John Nuveen CEO Richard Franke,
who took home $19.6 million. That total included a $16 million
restricted stock award when Nuveen went public last year.
</p>
<p>
   Two chief exexutives saw their pay decline. Bassett Winmill,
chief executive of Bull & Bear Group, saw his compensation fall 6%,
to $156,000. Mr. Winmill was the lowest-paid chief executive in the
survey.
</p>
<p>
   One fund chief executive who wasn't on the list was John Bogle,
head of Vanguard Group, the U.S.'s second-largest mutual fund group
and a firm owned by the shareholders of its mutual funds. Two
newsletters have estimated Mr. Bogle's 1992 compensation: In March,
Mutual Fund Forecaster estimated his pay at $2.7 million, and
recently Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors estimated it at
$3.3 million.
</p>
<p>
   The higher figure would have put Mr. Bogle as the fourth
highest-paid fund chief executive on the Fund Action list, after Mr.
Franke, Dave Williams of Alliance Capital Management ($9 million)
and Howard Stein of Dreyfus Corp. ($3.7 million). The lower figure
would have made him fifth highest, after Lawrence J. Lasser of
Putnam Investments, a subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan ($2.8 million).
</p>
<p>
   The compensation of most fund group chief executives -- including
Edward C. Johnson III, head of Boston fund giant Fidelity
Investments -- isn't available because the firms are closely held or
are subsidiaries of other firms.

<HL>    LEISURE & ARTS -- On Sports:
@  Big Bats, a Pouty Olympian, Salary Cap
@  ----
@  By Frederick C. Klein </HL>
<DD> 04/29/94 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A13 </SO>
<TXT>
<p>
   Bad things are supposed to come in threes, and so do the examples
needed to flesh out a newspaper column. I don't know if there's a
connection.
</p>
<p>
   I do know that some curious things have bubbled to the top of the
sports pot in recent days. Baseballs are flying, a 1992 Olympic
gold-medal winner is sighing and the salary outlooks of some
National Football League stars are dying. That adds up to three,
doesn't it?
</p>
<p>
   1. The tip-off on this spring's baseball power surge came on
opening day in Chicago, when Karl "Tuffy" Rhodes, a young player of
modest measurements who'd hit a total of five home runs in parts of
four previous Major League seasons, hit three in his first three
trips to the plate. The batting barrage hasn't continued apace, but
it has continued. Through Sunday, American League hitters were
averaging .274 with 1,393 runs scored and 303 home runs, against
.267, 1,177 and 204 on the same date last season. The National
League numbers were .261, 1,198 and 259 against .250, 1,045 and 189.
</p>
<p>
   Conclusion-jumpers concluded that the baseball has been "juiced"
to give more bang to the bash. That's always the first explanation
when the lines on the hitting charts rise sharply, as they do from
time to time. Official denials quickly followed, also as usual.
</p>
<p>
   There are alternative explanations. April weather has been
unusually warm in many places, producing muscle-loosening
temperatures and hitter-friendly westerly breezes. All the
iron-pumping ballplayers have been doing might be paying off. Last
season's two-team National League expansion, which added 20 or so
pitchers' jobs in the Majors, has thinned the talent in the game's
most important position.
</p>
<p>
   This time the obvious answer appears to be the likely one: That
baseballs are being juiced to create the runs that the moguls
believe put fannies in the seats. Subtle factors do not account for
a 43% increase in home runs.
</p>
<p>
   But what, I ask, is so terrible about that? Professional football
is forever tinkering with its procedures in order to satisfy its
fans' scoring desires-of-the-moment. Goal posts are widened or
narrowed, field hash marks are changed, defensive backs are leashed
and unleashed. There'll be a two-point-conversion option beginning
next season. Compared with that, baseball has been the very model of
stability, for which we should be grateful. And besides, juice is
good for you.
</p>
<p>
   2. The Olympian with the problem is Mark Lenzi, who finished
first in men's three-meter springboard diving at the 1992 Summer
Games in Barcelona. It seems that, unemployed at age 25 after
retiring from competition, the Bloomington, Ind., resident wanted to
go to airline-pilot school but lacked the wherewithal, whereupon he
announced he might sell his medal to raise funds. No sale has been
made, but the offer added several-fold, via the TV-talk-show
circuit, to his Warholian portion of celebrity.
</p>
<p>
   I watched one of the shows and thought the hostess's line of
questioning was interesting. Did Lenzi feel "cheated" that other
former Olympians such as Nancy Kerrigan were reaping millions of
dollars from their celebrity while he was not? she asked. And did he
now regret the "countless hours" he'd devoted to his sport? To his
credit, Lenzi answered "no" to both questions, but he did allow that
he was perplexed by his present plight. "While I was in training, I
never thought I'd be doing this," he said.
</p>
<p>
   Several pertinent points did not come out in this interview. One
was that Lenzi's athletic skills had earned him a full scholarship
to Indiana University, from which he was graduated in 1990. Another
was that, after his college days were done, he received regular
training stipends from his sport's governing body and the U.S.
Olympic Committee. A call to the USOC also revealed that on two
occasions Lenzi had obtained jobs through the group's placement
program but subsequently left them both, that he hadn't availed
himself of offers of further placement help, and that, in 1992, he'd
lost out on a $2,500 "Opportunity Gold" grant because he failed to
do some routine paperwork.
</p>
<p>
   A broader point, I think, has to do with the expectations of
present-day athletes. Somehow, the notion has gotten around that
success in sports provides -- or should provide -- a magical "open
sesame" to the world's goodies. The fact is that, mostly, it's just
a line in the resume, albeit a very good one. Notices to that effect
should be posted on locker-room walls.
</p>
<p>
   3. The footballers experiencing potential paycheck trauma include
some of the game's biggest names: Richard Dent and Neal Anderson of
the Chicago Bears, Rodney Peete and Andre Ware of the Detroit Lions,
Mark Rypien of the Washington Redskins and Alvin Harper of the
Dallas Cowboys.
</p>
<p>
   Their obstacle is the NFL's per-team salary cap; new this year,
it was part of the 1993 labor agreement that also brought free
agency to the league. It's an honest-to-gosh ceiling, unlike the
National Basketball Association's, which lets teams pay whatever
they need to re-sign their own free agents. The football version
saves spendthrift teams (i.e., the San Francisco 49ers) from
themselves while giving owners an easy "out" from fan criticism that
they're not doing their darnedest to field a winner.
</p>
<p>
   Football salaries generally will rise from last season, but some
veteran players are finding the pickings slimmer. Much the same
thing happened in baseball this year as a result of a reduction in
national television revenue. Stars in their primes are still pulling
top dollars in both sports, and the many more at the bottom are
getting the contractual minimums. Players in the middle are being
squeezed.
</p>
<p>
   There's some irony here. For years, team athletes have been
telling us they're really entertainers and should be paid as such.
Now, it looks like they're going to be.

<p>
   Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive officer
of Federated Department Stores Inc., certainly likes to shop where
he works.
</p>
<p>
   According to the proxy statement from the department store chain,
based in Cincinnati, Ohio, Mr. Questrom's salary and an additional
cash payment remained unchanged at $2 million for fiscal 1993, one
of the highest in general retailing. But his compensation also
included a whopping $168,301 in an "executive discount" on
merchandise purchased at Federated's stores, which include
Bloomingdale's, Burdines and Rich's, among others. A company
spokeswoman said Mr. Questrom took similar discounts in fiscal 1992.
</p>
<p>
   The spokeswoman said that, like executives at other retailers,
top Federated executives get a discount of roughly 40% off the
suggested retail price. She said that "a large portion" of the
purchases likely went to furnishing an old farmhouse in Connecticut,
which the flamboyant Mr. Questrom and his wife are restoring and
adding on to.
</p>
<p>
   Federated has been a solid performer under Mr. Questrom. In the
fiscal year ended Jan. 29, profit before charges grew about 48% to
$196.8 million. Under Mr. Questrom, Federated also bought a chunk of
R.H. Macy & Co. senior debt. Federated is now in talks with Macy
creditors on a reorganization plan that would merge the two chains.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Questrom signed one of the richest contracts in retailing in
1990. The proxy noted that Mr. Questrom was paid $2 million for
signing on as Federated chairman and is guaranteed both a $1.2
million salary and $800,000 "value-added payment" for each year of
his five-year contract. When his contract is up Feb. 2, 1995, he'll
be entitled to another payment based on any increase in Federated's
stock price during his five-year reign.
</p>
<p>
   Other Federated executives received smaller bonuses, which are
tied to the company's operating-profit level and "individual
performances" of executives. James Zimmerman, president and chief
operating officer, received a $1 million salary, but his bonus
dropped to $232,800 from $310,400 in fiscal 1992. He took $19,321 in
executive discounts.
</p>
<p>
   The salary of Ron Tysoe, Federated vice chairman and chief
financial officer, remained at $650,000, but his bonus dropped to
$185,7000 from $247,600 in 1992. He received $22,963 in shopping
discounts and $16,116 for a car allowance.

   Platinum Software Corp. lost nearly two-thirds
of its market value yesterday, as investors dumped their holdings on
news of expected heavy operating losses and the surprise
resignations of four top executives.
</p>
<p>
   The announcement sent shares of this maker of financial and
business-information software tumbling $6.4375, or 64.4%, to close
at $3.5625 a share in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. A total of 4.2
million shares, a third of the 12.4 million outstanding, changed
hands yesterday.
</p>
<p>
   Platinum said it anticipates a "substantial loss from operations"
on revenue of between $13 million and $15 million for its third
quarter ended March 31. The company also said it plans to take a
one-time restructuring charge of between $7 million and $10 million
and will restate its financial results as far back as September
1991, resulting in a corresponding decrease to stockholders equity
-- which stood at $56.9 million on Dec. 31 -- of about $13 million
to $20 million.
</p>
<p>
   Platinum also announced the resignations of Chief Executive
Officer Gerald R. Blackie, 40 years old, Chief Financial Officer Jon
R. Erickson, 37, and executive vice presidents, Kevin P.
Riegelsberger, 36, and Timothy J. McMullen, 36, all of whom have
also left the board.
</p>
<p>
   Carmelo J. Santoro, 53, will act as interim chief executive and
Bruce C. Edwards, 40, will serve as interim chief financial officer.
They are the only directors remaining.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Santoro said the executives resigned their posts voluntarily,
after weighing the probable fallout from the restatement of
earnings.

   MTC Electronic Technologies Co.'s
stock plunged to a 52-week low on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange Friday,
after the company disclosed a litany of troubles that have afflicted
its operations in China.
</p>
<p>
   After trading as low as $1.94 a share earlier in the day, MTC's
stock closed at $2.38 a share, down $1.13 on volume of 2.4 million
shares.
</p>
<p>
   The consumer electronics manufacturing and trading company, which
recently fired its chief executive and corporate secretary for
alleged financial improprieties, said it expects to report a
"substantial loss" for its year ended Jan. 31, 1994, reflecting
large write-offs and charges from its Chinese operations.
</p>
<p>
   The company revealed that its Dongugang paging system is having
software, billing and marketing problems; it said the system may be
overbuilt, hurting its short-term profitability prospects. And the
company said its Hubei cellular telephone system can't be activated
because it lacks handsets.
</p>
<p>
   MTC named a Chinese economic consultant as non-executive
chairman, succeeding fired chairman and chief executive Miko Leung.
Its new chairman, Li Kam Chung, is expected to manage activities
aimed at enabling MTC to conduct its joint venture in China and to
strengthen its government relationships there.
</p>
<p>
   MTC also said it started legal proceedings in Hong Kong against
several individuals, including its former chief executive and its
former corporate secretary. It said it is seeking to recover over
$10 million.
</p>
<p>
   The company said that the executives have been "completely
eliminated from all management functions" and that an executive
committee is "in full control of the company. . ." and is
reorganizing it.

<HL>    UAL's Designated Chief Executive Plans
@  Speedy Development of Short-Haul Line

<p>
   Gerald Greenwald, the chief executive
officer-designate for UAL Corp., said he plans to accelerate the
development of a new short-flight operation, perhaps stepping up
aircraft orders, to better defend United Airlines in the industry's
most hotly competitive arena.
</p>
<p>
   In an interview, the 58-year-old former Chrysler Corp. official
also said he is personally leading the search for a new president,
and is shepherding the creation of a marketing campaign that would
stress employee ownership of UAL's United Airlines.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Greenwald, selected as the new top officer by United's labor
leaders late last year, will assume his post as chairman and chief
executive this summer if shareholders approve a proposed majority
buyout by employee groups, as expected.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Greenwald made his remarks following a meeting with analysts
and institutional investors here in which he and UAL's top officers
tried to drum up support for the more than $4.67 billion
equity-for-concession plan. The proposal has met with a lukewarm
response by major shareholders and analysts uncertain about the
future performance of the nation's first airline to be
majority-owned by employees.
</p>
<p>
   One of Mr. Greenwald's first challenges will be to address
United's short-haul operation. "We need to stop current inroads" by
Southwest Airlines and other low-cost rivals, he said, adding that
the plan outlined in the prospectus for the buyout isn't aggressive
enough.
</p>
<p>
   In the prospectus, which was prepared by current management,
Chicago-based UAL said it would create a separate shortflight
operation that would mimic Southwest's profitable, no-frills
business. The new airline, with a code name of U2, would be rolled
out no later than four to six months after the deal closes, and
would operate 130 aircraft within five years. Without offering
specifics, Mr. Greenwald said, "I'd like to start it faster and grow
it faster."
</p>
<p>
   "I don't expect to destroy Southwest," he added, "just make it
more painful for them to grow and compete with us."
</p>
<p>
   But the trick for Mr. Greenwald will be making the new program
fly profitably, and history isn't in his favor. "The aviation
graveyard is filled with Southwest me-toos," says Kevin Murphy, an
airline analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co. "It is difficult to copy,
and U2 isn't a success story just because it's now on paper."
</p>
<p>
   Seeking a right-hand officer, Mr. Greenwald said he is having
discussions with candidates "with significant experience" at other
major airlines. The search by Mr. Greenwald, a former vice chairman
of Chrysler, should blunt criticism that the proposed employee
buyout of UAL would leave the nation's largest airline with
inexperienced senior management.
</p>
<p>
   Under the equity-for-concession transaction, Stephen Wolf,
United's current chairman and CEO, and John Pope, president, will
resign. That would leave United firmly in the hands of Mr.
Greenwald, who is an unknown in the airline industry, having never
worked for a carrier before.
</p>
<p>
   Defending himself, Mr. Greenwald said, "I was part of the
turnaround of a $90 billion company {Chrysler} that is doing fairly
well today."

   Newspapers Avoid
   Naming Names
@
</p>
<p>
   NEWSPAPERS OFTEN don't give credit when it comes to corporate
sponsorship of sports and arts events.
</p>
<p>
   The International Events Group, which tracks and researches
corporate sponsorships, recently asked newspaper editors in 23 major
U.S. and Canadian cities for their policy on naming corporate
sponsors in articles.
</p>
<p>
   IEG found that 12 newspapers name sponsors only on a first
reference, while eight avoid a mention whenever possible. Three
papers had no policies or guidelines and name sponsors on a
case-by-case basis.
</p>
<p>
   The editors had various reasons for not using sponsor names. Some
cited avoiding free advertising, the event's age, readers' ability
to identify the event and strangeness of the sponsor's name. Take
the Poulan/Weed Eater Bowl, also known as the Independence Bowl.
</p>
<p>
   "How would you like to be a TV commentator who has to say that a
few times?" says Rebecca Rolfes, IEG's vice president of external
relations. "You're just looking for flubs on the air. On the other
hand, sponsors generally feel that there's a lack of accuracy. If
it's called the Poulan/Weed Eater Bowl, then it's got to be called
that in the paper."
</p>
<p>
   By not having a consistent policy when it comes to mentioning
sponsors, newspapers may discourage corporate sponsorship and
minimize the potential effectiveness of the exposure from a
sponsorship, says Lesa Ukman, IEG's president.
</p>
<p>
   John Hancock Financial Services thought it wasn't getting the
proper credit for sponsoring the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas. So the
company renewed its sponsorship under the condition that "Sun" be
dropped from the event's name, forcing journalists to refer to the
game as the John Hancock Financial Services Bowl. The move was
beneficial, the company said, because it ended up spending $1.6
million for about $5.1 million in advertising exposure.

   High-Tech Firms Aim
   For Higher Visibility
@
</p>
<p>
   HAVING THE LATEST and greatest specifications and features was
once enough to sell high-tech products. Not anymore.
</p>
<p>
   "As more and more products come to market, it all boils down to
the strength of the brand," says Cathy Martin, manager of marketing
programs at IntelliQuest, a marketing information provider.
</p>
<p>
   At the first Brand Tech forum last fall in Dallas, 250 people
attended to get tips on how to build and capitalize on a brand name.
This year's Brand Tech forum, scheduled for September in San Jose,
Calif., will address co-branding, where companies join forces to
develop a new brand or market an existing one.
</p>
<p>
   Many large high-tech companies, like Intel, Microsoft and Apple
Computer, have strong brand names. But smaller companies are getting
in on the act, trying to distinguish their products from the
competition.
</p>
<p>
   Applied Microsystems is a Redmond, Wash., manufacturer of
emulators that help engineers debug programs embedded in computer
microprocessors. It wanted a simple image that would raise awareness
about its product. So its ad agency last year developed a print
campaign featuring frogs, nature's debuggers. In one ad, the "Rocket
Frog" symbolizes a fast-performing emulator. In another, the "Rambo
Frog" represents an emulator that goes on "search-and-destroy
missions."
</p>
<p>
   "We're in a staid technical business, and using the frogs has
brought a persona to the company," says Bill McAlister, Applied
Microsystem's director of marketing. "Whenever we go to conferences,
people recall the ad. Now there's a high degree of association, and
it's a positive one."
</p>
<p>
   TechnoBranding is the word Chuck Pettis has service-marked to
describe this process. "People don't buy on logic alone," says Mr.
Pettis, principal of Floathe Johnson, the Washington ad agency that
developed the frog campaign. "They use rational decision-making, but
ultimately a lot of purchases are made on chemistry and having a
relationship with the product."

   City Buses Becoming
   Billboards on Wheels
@
</p>
<p>
   ADVERTISERS HAVE found a new twist on an old promotional vehicle.
</p>
<p>
   They're covering buses in 11 cities from headlight to taillight
in huge painted or vinyl ads that practically encase the bus.
</p>
<p>
   The vehicles have the advertising value of a blimp, the impact of
a billboard and the market penetration of a bus, according to
Transportation Displays, the New York City company marketing the
concept.
</p>
<p>
   Using a patented technique, the bus windows are covered by a
transparent material that is then painted. Passengers can see out,
but pedestrians and motorists can't see in. What they do see is a
rolling mural.
</p>
<p>
   The Phoenix Suns rented exterior space on five city buses to
advertise the basketball team's 25th anniversary. One of the more
attention-getting buses sported a glowering picture of star player
Charles Barkley. "We got a lot of calls from parents and other
people wanting to know what routes the painted buses were on so they
could ride or look for them," says Andrea Han, a spokeswoman for the
Phoenix transit authority. "These were the same buses on the inside
but people specifically wanted to know where they could catch the
`Charles Barkley' bus."
</p>
<p>
   Buying bus space is usually part of a broader marketing campaign,
says Jim Edwards, a senior account executive with the Cerine Coyne
ad agency in New York City.
</p>
<p>
   "There's no way to track whether we're getting direct results or
not, but it's another way to keep our clients top of mind," Mr.
Edwards says.

unchanged at $18.
</p>
<p>
   Northwest Illinois, based in Freeport, has assets of $417 million
and earned $4.4 million, or $1.65 a share, last year. FirstRock,
Rockford, has assets of $408 million and earned $4.2 million in its
fiscal year ended June 30. FirstRock went public in October 1992.
</p>
<p>
   Dan Heine, president and chief executive officer of Northwest
Illinois, will serve as chairman and chief executive officer of the
new holding company, while David A. Ingrassia, president and chief

<DD> 04/07/94 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A15 </SO>

<p>
   Two months ago when the State Department announced that it would
focus on the treatment of women in its yearly report on human rights
conditions, the New York Times reported that officials "denied" that
the White House played any role in this new emphasis.
</p>
<p>
   About the same time, the Justice Department, in a reversal from
earlier positions, sided with the state of California and against
Barclays Bank in a pending Supreme Court case on how states tax
foreign-based companies. This prompted suggestions that the White
House was interfering with the independence of Justice's solicitor
general.
</p>
<p>
   Two weeks ago White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers was
bombarded with questions at a press briefing on the propriety of the
White House intervening in a Justice Department review of a clemency
request for Jonathan Pollard, the former naval officer convicted of
spying for the Israelis.
</p>
<p>
   These three very diverse episodes share a common thread: the
insane implication that the president of the United States is not
supposed to set the policy of his own administration. This absurd
notion has accelerated in recent weeks in the frenzy of the
Whitewater scandal.
</p>
<p>
   The president should not get involved in individual regulatory
matters; that's why independent agencies -- with members appointed
by the president -- were created. But certainly the president is
supposed to direct the policy of his own administration. These
recent anecdotes are illustrative.
</p>
<p>
   Let's hope that the White House played a role in deciding whether
to emphasize the treatment of women in U.S. human rights policies.
That's not a decision that should be left to the striped-pants set.
</p>
<p>
   The Barclays Bank taxation case is too arcane for my feeble mind,
so it's an open question to me whether the administration is
correct. But in 1992 Bill Clinton campaigned in California on
precisely this position. Right or wrong, he got a lot more votes
than any bureaucrats in the solicitor general's office.
</p>
<p>
   As for complaints about any White House involvement in the
Pollard clemency case, critics ought to read a simple document:
Article 2 of the Constitution. It states the president "shall have
power to grant reprieves and pardons." That responsibility rests
exclusively with the office of president.
</p>
<p>
   In the current climate, one top White House assistant says, "We
hear footsteps every time we get involved in anything
controversial."
</p>
<p>
   The presidency, for all the desirable checks and balances,
shouldn't function with such inhibitions. "The president ought to be
actively involved in governmental decisions," says Terry Eastland, a
conservative former Republican Justice Department official and
author of an acclaimed book on the power and prerogatives of the
executive branch. "That's why we elect a president. That's what the
Constitution says he's supposed to do."
</p>
<p>
   To be sure, some of the problems were initiated by liberals in
the 1980s, especially in the judicial area, in an effort to stem the
conservative Reagan tide. But today some conservatives, sensing
weakness in an activist Democratic president, are seizing the moment
to try to hamstring executive prerogatives. This sort of situational
positioning is dangerously shortsighted.
</p>
<p>
   The most dramatic catalyst was the story revealing that top White
House aides George Stephanopoulos and Harold Ickes had expressed
displeasure to two top Treasury Department officials over the
appointment of Jay Stephens, a former Republican prosecutor, to
handle some of the civil matters of the Whitewater-tainted Madison
Guaranty. Yet a careful look at the particulars and the broader
question on whether the administration has sought to manipulate the
Resolution Trust Corp. to protect the president suggests there is
little basis for such overreaction.
</p>
<p>
   Jay Stephens is a former U.S. attorney of unbridled political
ambitions who was fired by President Clinton a year ago and then
blasted the president. Since then, he's been an actively partisan
Republican whose conduct concerning the investigation of Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski was so outrageous that his Republican predecessor as
U.S. attorney called his actions "unprofessional."
</p>
<p>
   It would have been unthinkable for any White House aide not to
complain about this appointment; imagine John Sununu or Ed Meese
timidly accepting the appointment of a ferociously partisan liberal
Democrat to investigate matters involving President Reagan or Bush.
But the most important point is that, private sniping aside, there's
no evidence that anything was done to remove Mr. Stephens. If
intemperate phone calls become a felony, we'll have to double the
national debt to build enough new prisons.
</p>
<p>
   And while it was clearly a bad idea to make Deputy Treasury
Secretary Roger Altman the acting head of the RTC, it doesn't appear
that this agency has been compromised by Clinton political
appointees. Indeed, the administration nominated a prominent
Republican, Stanley Tate, to head the agency last year; the
selection won praise from such diverse editorial pages as the
liberal Miami Herald and conservative Wall Street Journal. Mr. Tate
dropped out late last year when Senate Banking Committee Chairman
Don Riegle refused to move the nomination.
</p>
<p>
   Republican Rep. Jim Leach, the most serious and level-headed
Republican Whitewater critic, has alleged there has been political
pressure on RTC investigators. But last week the two top RTC career
officials, John Ryan and Ellen Kulka, wrote a letter to Mr. Leach
flatly asserting that "no pressure has been exerted" by the Clinton
administration on the Madison Guaranty and Whitewater
investigations.
</p>
<p>
   The bottom line is that an active Republican was nominated to
head the RTC, a vehemently partisan Republican has been tapped to
probe part of the Madison Guaranty scandal, and there is no
documentation of any pressure or action by Clinton appointees to
impede any investigation. On Whitewater, there remain some serious
unanswered questions about dealings in Arkansas a decade or more
ago. Not only is the special counsel in order but Congress ought to
swiftly pass the independent counsel law and Robert Fiske ought to
be reappointed as a truly independent counsel. Congressional
hearings are absolutely essential.
</p>
<p>
   But to leap from that to suggestions that this administration has
engaged in systematic abuses of power and that the authority of this
executive ought to be curbed is nonsense. Political opponents would
like to use this as an effort to paralyze President Clinton. But
they would do well to remember that's a weapon that not only can,
but invariably will, be turned on them once one of their own returns
to the Oval Office.

   Harsco Corp. named Leonard A. Campanaro, senior
vice president of finance, to the additional post of chief financial
officer. He had been performing the duties of finance chief, but
didn't hold the title, said a spokeswoman for the company. Mr.
Campanaro, 45 years old, also was named to serve on the newly formed
senior management committee of this diversified industrial
manufacturing and service concern.
</p>
<p>
   Harsco assigned three other executives to new jobs and to the new
committee. Paul C. Coppock, 43, was named senior vice president,
general counsel, secretary and chief administrative officer, a new
post. William D. Etzweiler, 58, was named senior vice president and
chief operating officer of commercial and industrial products.
Barrett W. Taussig, 54, was named senior vice president and chief

   Sandoz AG announced a 14% jump in 1993 net income and
increased its dividend. The Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group
also appointed Rolf W. Schweizer chief executive officer.
</p>
<p>
   Although analysts widely expected a double-digit rise in
earnings, they said a dividend improvement of 23% to 58 Swiss francs
($40.62) a share from 47 francs was greater than expected.
</p>
<p>
   Sandoz also said its share capital would be simplified by
converting nonvoting participation certificates into registered
shares. The remaining two categories of registered and bearer shares
would be split in a ratio of 1 to 5.
</p>
<p>
   Sandoz's profit rose to 1.71 billion francs in 1993 from 1.5
billion francs a year earlier. The company said the growth was aided
by increased drug sales and improved margins in the
chemicals-and-environment sector.
</p>
<p>
   The appointment of the 63-year-old Mr. Schweizer as chief
executive also was unexpected. He will succeed Marc Moret, 70, who
kept the chairman and chief executive positions after Daniel C.
Wagniere, 57, became chief operating officer last year. Up until
then, Mr. Moret had held all three positions. Mr. Moret will
continue as chairman.

<HL>    Senate, House Move Closer to Hearings
@  On Whitewater; Dates Are Still Vague

<DATELINE> WASHINGTON </DATELINE>
<TXT>
<p>
   The Senate and the House are both moving closer to
hearings on Whitewater, although dates may not be nailed down
quickly.
</p>
<p>
   The House voted 408-15 to hold hearings on the web of issues
surrounding the Whitewater affair. The House followed the example of
the Senate and instructed its leaders to design a hearing format and
schedule that won't interfere with investigations launched by
Special Counsel Robert Fiske.
</p>
<p>
   Senate Republicans were preparing to propose the creation of a
special committee, containing the ranking Democrat and Republican
from each Senate committee that has jursidiction over the banking,
small business, tax and other issues that have been lumped together
in the Whitewater affair. The issues include the dealings of
President and Hillary Rodham Clinton with a failed Arkansas savings
and loan, their involvement in a former land company called
Whitewater Development Co., and their influence on financial
agencies in Arkansas and Washington. The Clintons have denied any
wrongdoing or impropriety.
</p>
<p>
   Last week the Senate voted 98-0 for a resolution instructing
Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) and Minority Leader
Robert Dole (R., Kan.) to work out the details this week for
hearings. But yesterday, both officials hinted that the arrangements
may not be solidified until after the Passover-Easter recess that
starts this week.
</p>
<p>
   In another Whitewater-related development, David Hale, a former
Little Rock municipal judge, pleaded guilty to two felony counts of
conspiracy and mail fraud. Mr. Hale has alleged that Mr. Clinton
pressured him to make a loan to Whitewater partner Susan McDougal
and that some of that money ended up in Whitewater accounts. Mr.
Hale's settlement of the charges, which was expected, means he will
be able to testify before a special grand jury to be convened this
week.
</p>
<p>
   The plea, Mr. Fiske said yesterday in federal court in Little
Rock, "will allow us now to investigate all of the allegations that
Mr. Hale has made . . . and other allegations he has made during the
time he has been cooperating with us."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Hale won't be sentenced for at least 120 days to give him
time to "fully demonstrate his cooperation with the government," Mr.
Fiske said. He could be sentenced to as much as 10 years in jail,
and be required to pay $500,000 in fines, but the judge is likely to
take his cooperation into consideration at the sentencing.
</p>
<p>
   As president of Capital Management Services Inc., a company
licensed by the Small Business Administration to make loans to
disadvantaged business people, Mr. Hale admitted that he had
defrauded the agency out of $900,000. He also admitted that between
1985 and 1991, he used government and CMS funds to make loans for
improper purposes. The recipients of those loans weren't disclosed,
but the loan to Ms. McDougal was made in 1986. Mr. Hale also said he
had made improper loans to three companies owned by Arkansas Gov.
Jim Guy Tucker and his family.
</p>
<p>
   Also yesterday, the Senate Banking Committee released a third
letter from Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman disclosing
additional discussions he held with White House officials. The
conversations followed a Feb. 2 meeting that Mr. Altman attended at
the White House on procedural matters related to possible government
charges involving Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, a failed Arkansas
thrift linked to the Whitewater investment.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Altman revealed the Feb. 2 meeting at a Banking Committee
hearing late last month. He had sent two previous letters to the
committee disclosing other contacts with White House officials in
which issues relating to Madison were discussed.
</p>
<p>
   In the newly disclosed meeting, Mr. Altman said he discussed his
decision to recuse himself from the Madison case and to step down as
acting head of the Resolution Trust Corp., the S&L cleanup agency.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Altman wrote the latest letter on the eve of his appearance
before a federal grand jury that is looking into whether the White
House tried to improperly influence the case. Mr. Altman and other
Treasury and White House officials have called their discussions
proper and above board.
</p>
<p>
   Separately, Patsy Thomasson, the White House director of
administration, told a House subcommittee that the Secret Service
issued her a permanent security pass on March 5. Republicans have
criticized the administration, and Ms. Thomasson in particular, for
working in the White House for over a year without the proper
security review that comes with such a pass.
</p>
<p>
   But Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia questioned the integrity of the
White House, saying he has been assured for months by Chief of Staff
Thomas McLarty that the administration wasn't taking any security
risks, only to learn from Ms. Thomasson that Mr. McLarty just
recently received his own permanent pass. Mr. McLarty, however, had
received other security clearances.
</p>
<p>
   Ms. Thomasson also said that four veteran consultants from the
presidential campaign -- Paul Begala, James Carville, Stanley
Greenberg and Mandy Grunwald -- would undergo background checks and
probably receive permanent non-government passes, instead of the
temporary ones they have been using.
</p>
<p>
   She insisted there were no instances in which the Secret Service
had rejected the issuing of a pass and been overruled by others in
the White House. But Ms. Thomasson conceded that Dee Dee Myers, the
press secretary, had access to documents requiring a security
clearance, even though she doesn't yet have a permanent pass. Ms.
Myers only recently completed the application paperwork and has a
temporary pass.

<p>
   Most of the top executives at the New York Times Co.
had their bonuses cut in 1993, while the company signed a lucrative
compensation pact with the chairman of the Boston Globe's parent
company acquired last year.
</p>
<p>
   According to the proxy statement for the media company's 1994
annual meeting, the annual bonus of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman
and chief executive officer, decreased 35% in 1993, to $384,560. The
company said the bonus is partially tied to financial performance
targets. However, Mr. Sulzberger's base salary was raised 3.5% to
$515,000 last year, because of his role in negotiating the
acquisition of the Globe and his leadership "in a difficult economic
climate," the company said. For 1993, New York Times Co.'s operating
profit improved 43% on revenue of $2.02 billion, up about 14% from
1992.
</p>
<p>
   A similar pattern was followed for most of the other top
officers, including President Lance R. Primis, whose bonus fell
about 13% to $265,760; and Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., publisher of
the company's New York Times flagship paper, whose bonus fell 46%,
to $194,089. The exception was Chief Financial Officer David L.
Gorham, whose salary rose 4.4% while his bonus increased 6.4%, the
company said, "in recognition of his role in connection with the
negotiation and completion" of the Globe deal.
</p>
<p>
   Under its agreement to acquire Affiliated Publications Inc.,
parent of the Globe, last October, New York Times Co. agreed to
employ William O. Taylor, Affiliated's chairman and chief executive
officer, until Dec. 31, 1998. During that time, Mr. Taylor is to
receive his current salary and benefits, "as adjusted in the
ordinary course." If he is fired, New York Times Co. agreed to
continue to pay him a salary and benefits based on a certain
formula. A spokesman for the New York Times said the company isn't
required to disclose Mr. Taylor's salary because "he isn't in the
top five."

</p>
<p>
   The offering, scheduled to begin in the fall with the start of
Ziff's Interchange on-line service, will offer news from the
Washington Post and include local sports, calendars of cultural
events, and other neighborhood news for Washington residents. The
service also will provide readers with electronic discussion groups,
including interactive "chat" with editors and reporters, and will
allow users to access the Internet, the global computer network.
</p>
<p>
   Donald K. Brazeal, editor and publisher of Digital Ink Co., said
the new Post subsidiary is pursuing other national and international
on-line offerings aimed at business users. News stories in the print
version of the Post will include referrals to the new on-line
service for additional information.
</p>
<p>
   Pricing for the service will be similar to the $9.20 monthly
subscription rate for the newspaper, based on a maximum number of
hours to be determined. For an extra fee, subscribers will be able
to access Ziff's Interchange service. Ziff is giving the Post and
other publishers control of the "look and feel" of their on-line

<p>
   Citizens Inc. said it expects today to post fourth-quarter net
income of $1.6 million, or 10 cents a share, exceeding analysts'
estimates.
</p>
<p>
   A year earlier, the company earned $563,000, or three cents a
share, after a charge of $264,000, or two cents a share, on an
accounting change.
</p>
<p>
   In an interview, Harold E. Riley, chairman and chief executive of
the Austin, Texas, life-insurance holding company, said revenue rose
32% to $13.5 million, from $10.2 million.
</p>
<p>
   Analysts expected Citizens to post net income of about seven
cents a share, said Mark Oliver, the company's chief financial
officer.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Riley attributed the improved results to continued growth in
sales of its ordinary whole-life insurance policies to customers in
developing countries who have high net worth. He predicted revenue
will grow 20% to 30% in 1994.

<p>
   The company also said two new directors -- Roland Breton and

   The company gave no reason for Mr. Lucas's dismissal. Neither he

</p>
<p>
   The management change is the latest in a series of events that
have shaken the company in recent months. As previously reported,
the Securities and Exchange Commission contacted several individuals
about their dealings with the company. One of those individuals said
the SEC had asked about how the company valued its assets.
</p>
<p>
   Those assets consist largely of video libraries. According to a
recent securities filing, an accountant formerly hired by Madison
recommended that an independent specialist be hired to evaluate the
video libraries.

   William "Skip" Moyer, 37 years old, a Federal Express courier and
father of four, was recently shot and killed while trying to deliver
a package in a drug-plagued Philadelphia neighborhood. The news
pictures of Mr. Moyer's body lying next to his truck transfixed
delivery workers across the country.
</p>
<p>
   "I could see that we're in the same kind of business and working
in the same kind of streets," says Daniel Kane, a driver for Herr
Foods Inc., a Nottingham, Penn., snack-food company. "I knew it
could have been me."
</p>
<p>
   With the rise of crime and random violence in America's cities,
companies that promise delivery to all areas, regardless of risk,
are becoming increasingly vulnerable. Their dilemma: how to fulfill
their commitment to their customers while keeping their employees
safe. Even precautionary measures and guidelines are doing little to
lessen fear among workers or to guarantee routine service for
inner-city customers.
</p>
<p>
   William Burris, an executive vice president of the American
Postal Workers Union, says his 320,000 members no longer feel exempt
from danger. "Robberies have increased significantly. There's a
great potential for violence," he says. In the year ended Oct. 1,
there were 213 robberies of postal workers nationwide, as compared
to 98 in 1989, according to the U.S. Postal Service.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Moyer was walking back to his delivery truck when a man
approached, tried to rob him and shot him in the face, police say. A
48-year-old suspect has been charged with the slaying.
</p>
<p>
   The killing, the first of a courier in Federal Express Corp.'s
20-year history, has the Memphis-based firm reassessing its service
in perilous neighborhoods. "We can't just simply withdraw from
high-crime areas," says a company spokesman. As a safety measure,
many drivers have been issued cellular telephones with instructions
to call their dispatchers and make different arrangements for a
dropoff if an area looks too risky. Also, the company is beginning
to double-up workers on trucks with dangerous routes.
</p>
<p>
   Drivers for Domino's Pizza Inc., the national pizza-delivery
chain, have been the target of many violent assaults over the past
year, and the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based company recently dedicated an
entire issue of its internal newspaper, "The Pepperoni Press," to
safety awareness. Drivers are instructed not to leave their cars if
a delivery area looks suspicious, and after dark, dispatchers are
required to call customers back to verify orders and phone numbers.
</p>
<p>
   In some neighborhoods, Domino's refuses to deliver pizzas to
certain buildings. In others, delivery service is denied after dark
in the summer. A spokesman for the company says Domino's encourages
store managers to familiarize themselves with nearby pay-phone
numbers, and to reject orders from phones in dangerous locations.
"There are areas where we have had incidents, and we won't go there
anymore," says the Domino's spokesman. "Those are tough decisions
because we want to sell as many pizzas as we can. But we can't put
our people at risk."
</p>
<p>
   United Parcel Service of America Inc. has significantly altered
the way it does business after a string of holdups in recent years.
If an area is known to be dangerous, the Atlanta-based company will
send a postcard requesting the customer to pick up the package from
the company's retail site, or "make arrangements to deliver at an
alternative site out of the embargoed area," says a company
spokesman.
</p>
<p>
   But companies don't want to lose customers because of their
attempts to ensure safety. Indeed, competition is tough for
inner-city customers, who range from mom-and-pop business owners to
elderly people who regularly have prescription drugs delivered to
their homes. "I don't think delivery companies can afford to let one
incident scare them away because there are too many competitors
around here," says Jim Young, head of the Germantown-Lehigh Avenue
Merchants Association, which represents 105 businesses in the
Glenwood area of Philadelphia, where the slaying occurred.
</p>
<p>
   Some residents of Glenwood say the man charged with Mr. Moyer's
killing broke a code of conduct that is indigenous to America's
ghettos. "There are certain people who come around and everybody
knows that these people are hands off," says Clarence Hester, a
local community organizer, minister and self-described former drug
user. "Even people involved in the drug trade are appalled at this
killing because they know that you just don't mess with government
officials, postal workers, UPS or Federal Express workers, because
they are all servicing your own people. It's the law of the land."
</p>
<p>
   Other Greenwood residents insist that there is no special premium
on the life of anyone. Last year, eight people were slain within a
20-block area where drug activity is heavily concentrated. "God
knows this happens all the time around here," says Mr. Young.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Moyer's colleagues are finding it hard to continue with their
own jobs. At the Federal Express station near Philadelphia's Center
City, parking slot number 21, where Mr. Moyer loaded his truck each
day, has been vacant since his death in December. "He parked in that
spot the morning before he was killed and no one wants to park there
again," says Kathy Skalish, manager of administrative duties at the
80-truck facility.
</p>
<p>
   Since the slaying, a number of employees have received
psychiatric counseling, provided by the company. And instead of
reassigning one person to Mr. Moyer's route, the company has divided
it up. "We don't think it's right anymore for someone to have to
spend their entire day in an uncomfortable area," says Bob Sladek,
one of Mr. Moyer's supervisors.
</p>
<p>
   Ralph Goff, who grew up in the Glenwood area, has taken over part
of Mr. Moyer's route. Not long ago, Mr. Goff had a package to
deliver on a drug-infested street, just a few blocks from where Mr.
Moyer's life ended. As he approached the block, he suddenly pulled
his truck over. In his two years with the company, "that was the
first time that I was apprehensive and uncomfortable delivering
something," Mr. Goff says. So he called his dispatcher and had the
customer meet the truck at the end of the block. "I couldn't do it,"
he says, shaking his head. "It was the first time."

   Another venerable corporate name belongs to the ages:
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. wants to be just plain AT&T Corp.

   The company, of course, has an unsentimental explanation for
wanting to change its name. It's more practical. And most people
know the telecommunications giant by its initials.

   "It's the perfect time, being that it's 10 years since our
breakup and telephone and telegraph doesn't describe the company we

   What they used to stand for was a name that symbolized a bygone

all: When it was broken up in 1984, AT&T was the world's largest

premiere research and development organization.

</p>
<p>
   Mr. Mead's succession was expected, the timing wasn't and Mr.
Walsh's decision came as a surprise to some of his closest
associates.
</p>
<p>
   Last month, Mr. Walsh underwent surgery to remove dead tissue
remaining from his brain tumor, discovered last year, and at the
time the company said his prognosis was favorable. "I think we were
all encouraged, and we're saddened," said Mr. House.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Walsh's doctors tell him the cancer isn't back, but he told
directors that the cumulative effects of surgery, chemotherapy and
other treatments have been more demanding than expected. Mr. Mead
said that Mr. Walsh, who he hasn't seen since late January, has
sounded "fatigued" in recent telephone conversations, and has
described continuing weakness on his left side. "The most recent
operation was to take care of that by relieving pressure from the
nerves. But those symptoms are persisting."
</p>
<p>
   The suddenness of Mr. Walsh's announcement left Tenneco uncertain
as to whether it will name a new president and chief operating
officer, or whether Mr. Mead will retain those titles.
</p>
<p>
   It's uncertain how Wall Street will react to Mr. Walsh's leave.
The day Tenneco announced in the summer of 1991 that he was to join
the company, the stock price surged $3.25 a share. In composite
trading yesterday on the Big Board, Tenneco fell $1.375, or 2.4%, to
close at $56.625.
</p>
<p>
   At Tenneco, Mr. Mead's responsibilities grew quickly, including
heading up the company's largest subsidiary, Case, a long-troubled
farm and construction-equipment maker. Mr. Mead was credited with
returning Case to profitability, posting a 1993 operating profit of
$82 million, vs. a loss of $260 million a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
   Tenneco is a diverse company with interests that include
natural-gas pipelines, automotive parts, packaging, chemicals and
shipbuilding. In 1993, the company reported net income of $426
million, or $2.44 a share, on revenue of $13.26 billion.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Walsh was diagnosed as having a midgrade brain tumor in
January 1993 and he underwent a treatment of radiation and
chemotherapy.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Mead has frequently functioned as chief executive officer
since Mr. Walsh's illness was diagnosed. He presented the company's
year-end 1993 financial results to Wall Street analysts earlier this
month and he has been in charge since Mr. Walsh's follow-up surgery.
</p>
<p>
   The new chief executive is a self-described compulsive organizer
who always carries three briefcases on business trips. "One is for
Case, another is Tenneco `have-to-do' stuff, and the third is
reading material" such as a biography of Theodore Roosevelt and
David Halberstam's book on the culture of the 1950s, he said.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Mead said he doesn't plan major changes, at least not
immediately. "We have Tenneco on a terrific trajectory. Our cost
structure is improved, our business positions are better and we have
cleaned up our balance sheet. We have financial flexibility that we
didn't have before. We're ready to enter a new phase-sustained
growth."

<HL>    MANAGING YOUR CAREER
@  ----
@  By Timothy D. Schellhardt </HL>
<DD> 02/23/94 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1 </SO>
<TXT>
<p>
   While the Recruiter
   Checks Your Resume,
   Investigate the Firm's
@
</p>
<p>
   WHEN A HEADHUNTER calls, watch out. You can make some major
blunders that might cost you an important career move.
</p>
<p>
   Look at what happened to John Sculley, Apple Computer's former
chairman. Earlier this month he abruptly resigned as chairman of
troubled Spectrum Information Technologies. Mr. Sculley claimed he
hadn't known about some accounting problems and a Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation before he joined the tiny
wireless-technology concern in October.
</p>
<p>
   The lesson: Investigate a company very thoroughly before you
accept a tempting job offer, career experts suggest. "For Sculley
not to have known some of those issues before going in with Spectrum
is surprising," says Terry Ebert, managing director of Ayers Group,
an executive recruiting and outplacement firm in New York. Yet many
executives conduct more research on stock picks for their personal
portfolios than they do about a prospective employer, Mr. Ebert
adds.
</p>
<p>
   It can be tempting to take a new position without closely
analyzing the company beforehand. Managers keen to change jobs or
fearful of a layoff often don't ask a lot of detailed questions
because they really want to make the switch, notes Carl Menk,
chairman of New York recruiters Canny, Bowen.
</p>
<p>
   But in today's competitive job market, the thoroughness of your
background checks may decide whether you win a senior-level post.
Anthony W.G. Lord, a managing director of A.T. Kearney Executive
Search, a division of A.T. Kearney, says few things turn off a chief
executive more "than when he asks a job candidate, `What do you
think of the company's announcement last week?' and the candidate
replies, `What announcement?'"
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Ebert advises that you practice extensive "due diligence"
before accepting a job offer. Conduct a thorough check of articles,
legal briefs and investment analysts' reports about the company.
@
</p>
<p>
   CREDIT BUREAUS can be a good source of information about a
private business. Industry trade groups, the attorney general in the
state where the company is based and government agencies may be able
to tell you about pending regulatory or disciplinary actions. If
it's a public company, examine annual reports for the past five
years to uncover other evidence of recurring financial, management
or legal problems. For example, Spectrum's general counsel
Christopher Franco maintains that Mr. Sculley could have learned
about the company's accounting problems by reading its quarterly SEC
filings. A spokesman for Mr. Sculley replies, "He did everything he
thought was necessary at the time. In retrospect, he might have done
things differently."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Ebert suggests that you also meet with would-be peers during
the interviewing process "to assess the company's management style,
business ethics and morale." The chief information officer at a
major insurance company didn't do enough of this kind of homework
before he took the No. 2 position at a smaller insurer undergoing a
turnaround. He and the chief executive officer soon clashed over
their management styles. Within 18 months, the newcomer was out of
the job.
</p>
<p>
   If the ousted executive "had simply done some background checks
on the CEO, he would have unearthed the mismatch in management
styles," Mr. Ebert notes.
</p>
<p>
   Executives can blunder by assuming there won't be a careful check
of them. More companies are doing a fuller job of investigating job
candidates' claims of prior compensation, primarily by asking for
individuals' W-2 income statements. Recruiters say executives often
inflate their compensation by 10% to 20% -- or more. Contenders
sometimes explain they've simply figured in the value of their perks
and business travel.
@
</p>
<p>
   SUCH CREATIVE mathematics can alter a hiring decision. "Some
clients, depending on the situation, will say the person is terrific
and decide, `Let's go ahead,'" says Kearney's Mr. Lord. "Others will
say there's absolutely no way they'll hire the person."
</p>
<p>
   Many headhunters report they're also seeing more job seekers
lying about their credentials. Christopher Polson, a Minneapolis
recruiter, recently verified the resumes of 11 semifinalists for a
$200,000 top financial post at a major construction concern. He
found that two had misrepresented their college backgrounds. One man
claimed an M.B.A. degree when he only had a bachelor's. The other
candidate said he had an accounting degree when it was a business
degree. "What a stupid thing to do by people of accomplishment," he
says. Neither man got the job.
</p>
<p>
   Some candidates also fudge by not coming clean about a prior
dismissal. And with laid-off executives often getting use of offices
and secretaries through outplacement concerns, it isn't easy for
headhunters to quickly determine whether an executive is actually
unemployed. Though risky, such concealment is understandable. You
enhance your chances of being hired -- especially for more money --
if you are working.
</p>
<p>
   But savvy recruiters almost certainly will discover the truth.
One way is by asking: When was the last day you worked? If you
obfuscate, you will only raise doubts in a recruiter's mind.
</p>
<p>
   "Don't play games. Tell us about any warts you have," counsels E.
Pendleton James, a New York headhunter. After all, he adds, "what is
a wart to you may not be to me."

@  Stocks Climb as Investors Shrug Off
@  Concerns About Greenspan Testimony

<TXT>
<p>
   After some early market choppiness, small-company
stock investors decided Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's
congressional testimony was harmless and bid prices higher.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Greenspan suggested that short-term interest rates will rise
again, but he wasn't specific about when. Market players showed
caution as the testimony began, but they later tossed aside their
concerns.
</p>
<p>
   The Russell 2000 Index, which tracks the performance of
small-capitalization stocks traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market and
the major exchanges, jumped 1, or 0.38%, to 265.05 after losing
ground in the previous two sessions.
</p>
<p>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 2.30, or 0.29%, to 791.15.
Declining Nasdaq issues outpaced advancers 1,599 to 1,404 on light
Nasdaq National Market volume of 228,876,600 shares and total volume
of 263,269,000. On Friday, National Market volume was 249,412,200
shares, while overall turnover stood at 300,633,500.
</p>
<p>
   The stock and bond markets were closed Monday in observance of
Presidents Day.
</p>
<p>
   A modest rebound in the bond market also helped pave the way for
gains in the smaller-stock group. The Treasury's long bond jumped
5/16 point.
</p>
<p>
   Bonds stopped sliding after Greenspan told Congress that he sees
inflation rising "only a little" this year.
</p>
<p>
   Traders said the reaction on the Big Board also worked as a
positive for the broader market, including small-cap stocks. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average soared more than 24 points and the Dow
Jones Utility Average surged 3.23 to 211.77. A slide in the utility
index recently has worried market watchers who say a poor
performance by the barometer portends an overall market correction.
</p>
<p>
   Among semiconductor issues, KLA Instruments, San Jose, Calif.,
climbed 1 3/4 to 37 3/4; Bolt Beranek & Newman, Cambridge, Mass.,
added 5/8 to 16 3/8 on the Big Board, and Novellus Systems, also of
San Jose, rose 1 1/2 to 43 1/4.
</p>
<p>
   Energy companies were in the spotlight. For instance, Atwood
Oceanics of Houston jumped 2 to 13 1/2. According to this week's
issue of Barron's, the oil and gas exploration and development
company offers a way to buy drilling assets at a discount and get a
free ride on any tightening of daily rig rates.
</p>
<p>
   Benton Oil & Gas, Oxnard, Calif., jumped 1 1/16 to 5 3/4
following an upgrade to "strong buy" from "buy" by Kidder, Peabody &
Co. analyst Bernard Picchi. Also, Benton said today it has acquired
an additional 30% stake in Benton-Vinccler, its Venezuelan venture,
for $13 million and 200,000 common shares.
</p>
<p>
   Shares of Castle Energy dropped 1 5/8 to 8 7/8 after German
shareholder Metallgesellschaft said it might sell its 40% stake in
the Blue Bell, Pa., oil and gas refiner.
</p>
<p>
   On the earnings front, Pure Tech International, Somerset, N.J.,
plunged 2 1/4 to 8. The recycling concern reported a fiscal
second-quarter loss of 48 cents a diluted share on restructuring
charges, compared with net income from continuing operations of 10
cents a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
   Allen Group gave up 1 to 15 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Beachwood, Ohio, antenna manufacturer's fourth-quarter earnings
came in at 32 cents a share, below analysts' estimates of 34 cents.
In the year-earlier period, Allen posted net income from continuing
operations of 30 cents.
</p>
<p>
   LCI International, McLean, Va., bounced 4 1/8 higher to 40 7/8
after reporting that its fourth-quarter loss narrowed to 82 cents a
share with charges from $3.78 a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
   In addition, it was reported yesterday that LCI has agreed to
provide United Consumer Financial Services with domestic and
international voice and data telecommunications services as part of
a three-year contract valued at $7 million.
</p>
<p>
   EA Engineering, Science and Technology of Hunt Valley, Md.,
surged 5 3/4 to 26 1/4 after it signed a contract valued at as much
as $75 million with the Baltimore District, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, to provide hazardous, toxic and radioactive-waste,
environmental-engineering services.
</p>
<p>
   South of the border, American depositary receipts of some Mexican
companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange fell on news that
the government said 1993 growth was a disappointing 0.4%, off from
government estimates of 1.1%. Empresas La Moderna, a Mexican
cigarette producer and distributor, fell 1 5/8 to 29 7/8; Bufete
Industrial, a construction company, dropped 1 3/4 to 48 3/4, and
Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, also a construction company, gave up 1
1/8 to 20 7/8.
</p>
<p>
   Brazilian funds, meanwhile, got a boost after the Sao Paolo Stock
Exchange posted its biggest rally of the year, with confidence
renewed that the government's economic plan will pass through
Congress. Brazil Fund jumped 2 1/4 to 30 3/4, and Brazilian Equity
Fund gained 1 3/4 to 24 1/4, both on the Big Board.
</p>
<p>
   "The lack of any extraordinary comments one way or another from
Greenspan really helped us," said Larry Kinney, head of
over-the-counter trading at SoundView Financial Group. "After some
early indecision, we gained strength as he signaled the uptick in
rates wouldn't occur right away."
</p>
<p>
   Peter Coolidge, a senior equity trader at Kidder Peabody, said
that after two down sessions, small-cap stocks were due for a
bounce, but "the market was a little bit nervous, and nobody wanted
to commit themselves until they could determine what Greenspan's
comments and his actions would mean."
</p>
<p>
   Although Mr. Coolidge said yesterday's action "did not validate
the correction theory" that many analysts have put forth in the past
few weeks, all in all the session doesn't have much effect because
"there weren't a lot of players around."

<HL>    The Clinton Budget:
@  From Ship of State, President's Plan
@  Sets Out to Scrape a Few Barnacles
@  ----
@  By Ron Suskind
@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<DD> 02/08/94 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A13 </SO>
<IN> MARINE TRANSPORTATION (MAR) </IN>
<DATELINE> WASHINGTON </DATELINE>
<TXT>
<p>
   Yesterday was a dark day for the Beluga Whale
Committee, for Atlantic Bluefin Tuna Research, and for the Zebra
Mussel research community.
</p>
<p>
   In his quest for something -- anything -- to eliminate from the
federal budget, President Clinton is proposing to eliminate scores
of tiny programs all across the government. Although the dollar
amounts in the $1.5 trillion budget are tiny, a look at the Commerce
Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, where
the president is proposing to eliminate more than 40 programs,
suggests that the trims may make up in piquancy what they lack in
size.
</p>
<p>
   For example, the budget raises this question: Where can an ousted
Samoan meteorologist find work? That was the concern preoccupying
Akapo Akapo, who with his seven fellow National Weather Service
staffers have their very own line item in the dread "Illustrative
listing of programmatic terminations and reductions" pages in the
president's federal budget. "This is the first I've heard about
cuts. . . . News, you know, travels slowly to here," says the
46-year-old Mr. Akapo as he checks barometric pressure at his tiny
Weather Service station in lush, tropical Samoa. "I guess it's the
unemployment line for me. Oh boy, I've got to call my wife."
</p>
<p>
   Then there are those 10-foot-wide buoys off the California coast
that cost about $100,000 a year to keep in barnacles. Federal budget
cutters have been trying to sink them since the mid-1980s, but as
quickly as they disappeared from one part of the budget they would
show up in another, thanks to intercession by Congress; California
fishermen and boaters who troll near the buoys' two sites off the
coasts of Santa Cruz and Los Angeles say the information on weather
and currents supplied by the gizmo-loaded bobbers is invaluable.
</p>
<p>
   At various times, the buoys hid in budgets for the Coast Guard
and the Department of the Interior, before showing up in NOAA's
budget sometime in the late 1980s. But that may be their last safe
port. When Capt. Craig Nelson, of NOAA's National Ocean Service, saw
the proposed federal budget yesterday morning, he immediately called
a colleague at the National Weather Service. "I said, `There's got
to be some way to save them -- you got any room in your budget?'"
says Capt. Nelson, already feeling separation anxiety. "He said, `It
doesn't look good.'"
</p>
<p>
   One problem with agencies like NOAA, says Capt. Nelson, is a
wealth of line-item funding and programs with weird names. "Some of
it just jumps out" at a budget cutter, he says. That's the case with
the Zebra Mussel and Bluefin Tuna programs, both of which are
targeted for extinction.
</p>
<p>
   It's also the case with the Beluga Whale Committee. The group has
received $200,000 a year for the past five years or so, says Tamra
Faris, a fisheries biologist at the Alaska regional office of NOAA,
which has helped run the program. Most of the money actually ends up
with the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, which speaks at whaling
conferences in favor of its right to fish the whales for
subsistence.
</p>
<p>
   Their opponents -- environmentalists who don't think the whales
should be hunted for any reason -- have the added weapon of a battle
cry: "Baby Beluga," a cuddly ode to the white whales by Raffi,
folk-singing star for America's two-year-old set.
</p>
<p>
   "Sure, my kids have listened to the song, but people need to
understand the issues are broader than that," says Ms. Faris
tersely.
</p>
<p>
   The Mystic Maritime Education and Research Center, at the
restored Seaport in Mystic, Conn., has 387 historic boats in a huge,
abandoned velvet mill, where a "leaky roof and miserable conditions
has caused some damage, though it's not a crisis -- yet," says Chris
Cox, who helps run a corporation that manages the Seaport. The
problem is that $1 million a year in federal funds to help turn the
old mill into a museum have been slated for cutoff. "We're just in
the middle of renovation, we can't stop now," says Mr. Cox, who adds
that Seaport officials are hoping Connecticut's congressional
delegation will not allow "these unconscionable cuts."
</p>
<p>
   Then there is the Wind Profiler Demonstration Network, which has
enjoyed annual funding of $4.4 million over the past few years to
build 32 ground-based devices that measure atmospheric winds from
1,500 to 15,000 feet above the Earth's surface.
</p>
<p>
   Up there the political constituency is thin, but some pilots have
found such data useful -- especially in avoiding strong headwinds
that eat up fuel. In fact, there were hopes that this pilot program
would be expanded -- until yesterday's chill wind.
</p>
<p>
   Though National Weather Service spokesman Frank Lepore says the
data collected by the devices went to a government research center
in Boulder, Colo., no layoffs are expected if the program is
actually terminated. Ozone research is hot, Mr. Lepore observes, and
the Wind Profiler staffers might well move over to that.
</p>
<p>
   As for the fate of the devices themselves -- which look like
six-foot-tall bedsprings, "I'm not sure what we'll do," Mr. Lepore
says. "I just can't take any more stuff in my house."

   The Clinton budget would jack up the price of
cigarettes, as well as making it more expensive to visit
Yellowstone, get a copy of your tax return, sell a gun or trade
stocks.
</p>
<p>
   The new budget hits only smokers with a tax increase, up 75 cents
a pack to 99 cents, which would pay for the administration's
ambitious health-care plan. But the budget would raise about $1.5
billion in new user fees in fiscal 1995, yielding about $8.4 billion
through 1999.
</p>
<p>
   In a budget geared toward reducing the deficit, the user fees are
more palatable politically than higher taxes. For one thing, they
don't require separate tax legislation. Moreover, the fees help
cover the costs of government services without adding to the budget
deficit. "These are important because they allow you to spend more
on other things," said Stanley Collender of Price Waterhouse, who
closely follows the federal budget.

<p>
   Leon Panetta, head of the Office of Management and Budget,
defended the user fees at a news conference yesterday, saying that
they don't exceed those in spending plans proposed by congressional
Republicans.
</p>
<p>
   Wall Street and pharmaceutical companies get hit with the biggest
fees. The budget estimates that the Food and Drug Administration
will reap $338 million in fiscal 1995 by charging drug companies for
the process of approving new products.
</p>
<p>
   The FDA fees stem from recent laws calling for speedier FDA
approvals or rejections of new drugs and medical devices as well as
for new inspections for mammography equipment. An application for
the FDA to test and approve a new drug, for example, will be
$208,000 in fiscal 1995. The FDA is to increase its staffing for
those purposes.
</p>
<p>
   A variety of securities fees would raise $378 million in fiscal
1995. For instance, the fee on the sales of stocks would increase to
1/250 of 1% of the sales amount from 1/300 of 1%. And all those
corporate titans battling to buy Paramount Communications Inc.,
beware: The fee on tender offers and mergers will increase to 1/29
of 1% of the transaction price from 1/50 of 1%.
</p>
<p>
   That $10 billion deal, for example, would result in a $3.4
million fee to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</p>
<p>
   Other proposed new fees include:
</p>
<p>
   -- A boost in the maximum drive-in fee at national parks to $16
from the current $10.
</p>
<p>
   -- Gun dealers would be assessed $600 a year, up from $200 a
year, raising $25 million a year.
</p>
<p>
   -- The Internal Revenue Service would charge $12 for photocopies
of tax returns, up from $4.25 previously, raising $5 million.
</p>
<p>
   -- And the Agriculture Department would begin charging for
overtime for its meat and poultry inspectors, raising $103 million
in fiscal 1995.

@  Firms Designate Some Openings for Women Only
@  ----
@  By Joann S. Lublin
@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<DD> 02/07/94 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1 </SO>
<TXT>
<p>
   Some big companies are trying to break their glass ceilings.
</p>
<p>
   They are putting out the word that only women need apply for some
of their top jobs. That's a turnabout from the recent past, when
women were considered last -- if at all -- for senior posts,
executive recruiters say.
</p>
<p>
   The new practice, arising from a desire to diversify upper
management, is controversial -- and potentially illegal. When
businesses exclude men from consideration for lucrative managerial
posts, they risk reverse sex-bias suits and a disruptive loss of
morale among male employees, authorities say. "This may be a ticking
time bomb waiting to go off," warns Gloria Allred, a Los Angeles
lawyer who specializes in women's rights cases.
</p>
<p>
   Some corporations try to sidestep the issue by telling recruiters
merely that they would "prefer" to hire a woman if qualified
candidates exist. Such targeted searches are multiplying, dozens of
executive women and headhunters say.
</p>
<p>
   "The trend has dramatically increased over the past year or so,"
says Yvonne Jackson, senior vice president of human resources at
Burger King Corp., a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC. Recruiters
seeking women for managerial spots call her once a week. Two years
ago, she says, she got such calls once every three months.
</p>
<p>
   Indeed, Burger King's search for a woman landed Ms. Jackson her
six-figure job in December. The company looked outside after inside
contenders for the job -- all male -- failed to qualify. The
fastfood chain says it interviewed only women because its chief
executive officer, James Adamson, insisted that senior management
better reflect Burger King customers, nearly half of whom are
female. The selection of Ms. Jackson, a former Avon Products Inc.
executive, added a second woman to Burger King's 10-member executive
committee.
</p>
<p>
   Korn/Ferry International, the nation's biggest search firm, says
it was asked to find a woman in 4.1% of its executive assignments
during fiscal 1993. Five years ago, says Madeleine Condit, head of
the firm's U.S. diversity practice, that proportion "would have been
nil."
</p>
<p>
   During the past year, five companies asked Corporate Directions,
a career-counseling and search firm in Torrance, Calif., to fill
middle-management and senior-level jobs with women, says George
Schmutz, president. Four said, "We will interview men, but we are
only going to hire women," he recollects. "One company said, `Don't
waste my time sending me men.' So, I only sent women."
</p>
<p>
   A.T. Kearney Executive Search is getting twice or three times as
many requests for female-targeted searches as it had 18 months ago,
says Charles W. Sweet, president of the A.T. Kearney Inc. division.
Last June, for example, Kearney helped the Chicago Sun-Times recruit
Bernadette Soens as controller. The 44-year-old Ms. Soens,
previously chief financial officer of a small manufacturer in Niles,
Ill., is the only woman among the newspaper's eight vice presidents.
</p>
<p>
   Sun-Times officials say they interviewed only female outsiders
for the controller's job because the internal candidates -- all men
-- lacked sufficient experience and because Ms. Soens's predecessor
was a woman. Joseph P. Gaynor, an executive vice president of the
parent Chicago Sun-Times Co., says the company figured that a good
way to find another senior woman was to look in areas like finance,
where there would be larger pools of qualified women candidates.
</p>
<p>
   Other employers aggressively seeking female managers also
pinpoint specialties in which experienced contenders are more likely
to be found, including human resources, public relations, legal
affairs and other staff functions. But some female managers fear the
tactic will perpetuate "pink" ghettos. "If we are really going to
diversify our workplaces, it can't just be in finance or in human
resources," argues Beverly Pierce, communications director of
AlliedSignal Inc.'s braking-systems unit in South Bend, Ind.
</p>
<p>
   Ms. Pierce became the first woman on her unit's 12-member
management team when AlliedSignal hired her to direct the unit's
public relations in September 1992 following an outside hunt for a
woman. The team gained a second woman last August. Yet Ms. Pierce,
39 years old, still faces constant reminders of her gender's
scarcity in upper management. She works in the unit's executive
suite. But "there is only one bathroom on that floor," she notes.
"It says: `Men.'"
</p>
<p>
   Virginia Lundquist, an AlliedSignal public-affairs vice
president, helped to choose Ms. Pierce from a list of five women. "I
was quite happy with the fact we could put in a female," says Ms.
Lundquist, the only senior woman executive in AlliedSignal's
automotive sector, which employs 35,000. But even though Ms. Pierce
has worked out well, Ms. Lundquist says, "we aren't going to direct
all searches to be gender-specific."
</p>
<p>
   Her attitude isn't surprising. When companies limit executive
recruiting to women, they expose themselves to attacks from
overlooked men. So far, few men have challenged gender-specific
searches. But a qualified male aspirant excluded because of his sex
may feel "he has gotten the short end of the stick," says Joseph D.
Luksch, a partner with Epstein Becker & Green, a management law firm
in New York.
</p>
<p>
   A hard-goods manufacturer with $150 million in annual sales
recently lowered the experience requirement for the head of its
retail division rather than consider men, recalls Susan Landon, a
principal at recruiters Lamalie Amrop International in New York.
"They didn't want to hear about male candidates," she says. "They
were more willing to change the specifications." (As it turned out,
the woman who was hired met the original requirement.)
</p>
<p>
   Whether a business considers both sexes or just women, though, a
female-targeted search doesn't always succeed. Three years ago,
Xerox Corp.'s chairman, Paul Allaire, sought a woman to be the
company's human-resources vice president, an informed individual
recalls. But the company rejected three external female candidates
because they lacked experience in handling large-scale
organizational change. William F. Buehler, an American Telephone &
Telegraph Co. executive, was hired instead. Finally, in 1992, Mr.
Allaire promoted Mr. Buehler and replaced him with Anne Mulcahey,
previously director of human resources.
</p>
<p>
   Some big businesses simply refuse to give up in their quests for
outside female executives. Burger King went 18 months without a
human-resources chief because its search for a woman with global
experience took longer than expected.
</p>
<p>
   "We all grumbled a lot" about the pinch hitting required,
remembers Cori Zywotow, Burger King's vice president of
communications. "But we wanted it to be right, not fast."

<HL>    The Outlook --
@  Gore's Data Highway:
@  Another Entitlement

<TXT>
<p>
   Amid the celebration of the 1992 Democratic
convention came some jarring words from former Rep. Barbara Jordan
of Texas. "We must address the question of entitlements," she told
Democrats in her keynote address. "That's not easy," she added,
repeating the phrase twice for emphasis. "But we have to do it. We
have to do it."
</p>
<p>
   Ms. Jordan's booming message signaled the emergence of a new
rhetorical consensus in mainstream American politics: "entitlements"
-- a fuzzy word for government benefits ranging from Social Security
to food stamps -- must be cut. The mantra was heard throughout last
year's budget debate. And Democratic Rep. Marjorie
Margolies-Mezvinsky from Philadelphia's Main Line even held a highly
publicized conference last month on the "Future of Entitlements,"
attended by President Clinton.
@
</p>
<p>
   But actions speak louder than words. In the midst of this flurry
of antientitlement talk, the Clinton administration has laid three
large new entitlement programs on the table.
@
</p>
<p>
   The first is a health-care reform proposal that entitles every
American to a generous health-insurance plan. The second is a
welfare-reform plan that wins praise from conservatives by promising
to "end welfare as we know it" but in fact amounts to a costly
promise of a job for every able American. And the third, and least
understood, is Vice President Al Gore's call for "universal service"
on the "information superhighway"the popular name for a broad-band
system that allows two-way communications on multiple channels.
</p>
<p>
   The nation must avoid creating a society of "information haves"
separate from "information have-nots," Mr. Gore said in a recent
speech to Hollywood haves, such as Disney's Michael Eisner. "It is
critically important . . . that all carriers must be obliged to
contribute, on an equitable and competitively neutral basis, to the
preservation and advancement of universal service." Translation: We
must tax phone, cable and other information services to subsidize
access to the superhighway for everyone.
</p>
<p>
   The notion of guaranteeing everyone access to a service that
doesn't yet exist may seem more amusing than disturbing. After all,
what is being guaranteed? The inalienable right to shop from home by
video? Or to watch interactive Court television and cast a personal
verdict in the Menendez trial?
</p>
<p>
   But Mr. Gore and his followers insist that traffic on the
information superhighway will include invaluable educational
programs, health-care hot lines and job-posting services. Anyone
without a vehicle could be left on the shoulder of life.
</p>
<p>
   Administration officials also argue that their proposal would
merely expand on the huge subsidies already implicit in the current,
regulated phone system. Business and long-distance users now
subsidize telephone rates for residential and rural users by as much
as $20 billion or more a year.
</p>
<p>
   But that hidden telephone subsidy exhibits the very attributes
that make more explicit government-entitlement programs so vexing.
Only a small portion of the telephone benefits -- less than a
billion dollars, says Eli Noam, professor of finance and economics
at the Columbia Business School -- goes to the truly needy. Most of
the subsidy goes to the middle class. And a not-inconsequential
portion goes to the very affluent, subsidizing, for instance, phone
lines to Taos, N.M., and Aspen, Colo.
</p>
<p>
   The subsidy plan proposed by Mr. Gore will probably be similar.
The administration has no thought of requiring that subsidies go
only to the needy -- which would undercut the political backing they
seek from powerful senators in rural states who want the subsidies
to serve their constituents. Instead, the administration's plan will
probably let states determine how to spend the money. And politics
will drive that money to the middle class, where the votes are.
@
</p>
<p>
   The nation can afford to provide, if it wants, wide-ranging
services and subsidies for the poor. What it can't afford, without
much higher taxes, is to continue to expand government subsidies and
services for the middle class.
@
</p>
<p>
   As former Commerce Secretary Pete Peterson illustrates in his new
book "Facing Up," government spends $109.8 billion a year on federal
benefit programs for those living in poverty; it spends a $570.7
billion for those who aren't. And the average benefit going to
households with incomes over $100,000 is larger than that going to
households with incomes under $10,000.
</p>
<p>
   Some economists say there may be an economic argument for
subsidizing universal access to the information superhighway: If
everyone is on it, it will have added value for businesses that want
to use it. That is a variant of what Atlantic magazine has dubbed
Mr. Clinton's "Field of Dreams" theory of economic growth, which
argued that if you build better public infrastructure, private
investment will come.
</p>
<p>
   But that isn't the argument Mr. Gore is making. Instead, he is
paving the way for a big new middle-class entitlement program that
would increase the government's drag on the economy for decades to
come.

   E-Systems Inc. said E. Gene Keiffer stepped down as
chief executive officer and intends to retire in August as chairman.
</p>
<p>
   The defense-electronics concern named its president and chief
operating officer, A. Lowell Lawson, to succeed Mr. Keiffer as CEO.
The company said Mr. Lawson, 56 years old, is also expected to
succeed Mr. Keiffer as chairman. Mr. Keiffer, 64, is to remain on
the board after his retirement as chairman.
</p>
<p>
   The company also said it named Brian D. Cullen a senior vice
president, in addition to his duties as president and general
manager of E-Systems' largest division, located in Greenville,
Texas. Mr. Cullen, 53, will share operational responsibilities with
two other senior vice presidents, Terry Heil, 55, and Peter Marino,
51.
</p>
<p>
   Industry analysts said Mr. Keiffer's departure as chief executive
wasn't unexpected and they generally praised the company's moves.
"The biggest positive is the nice continuity," said Howard Rubel, an
analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
</p>
<p>
   In a news release, Mr. Keiffer said the management changes were
designed to facilitate an orderly transition and streamline
management at a time when the defense contractor is seeking to
expand into lines of business unrelated to defense.
</p>
<p>
   Separately, E-Systems yesterday reported fourth-quarter net
income of $31.9 million, or 93 cents a share, up 9% from $29.3
million, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had projected
earnings of between 94 cents and 99 cents a share. Revenue fell
5.6%, to $523.6 million, from $554.9 million.

   USA Waste Services Inc. said it agreed to acquire
Houston-based Envirofil Inc. in exchange for stock valued at $139.5
million.
</p>
<p>
   Both companies are in the solid-waste collection and disposal
business. The combined entity will retain USA Waste's name and
generate annual revenue of about $175 million, USA Waste said.
</p>
<p>
   Under the agreement, Envirofil shareholders will receive one
share of USA Waste's common stock for every five shares of
Envirofil's common stock outstanding. The transaction, which is
subject to shareholder approval, will increase USA Waste's stock
outstanding to 20.8 million common shares from 11.5 million common
shares.
</p>
<p>
   Donald F. Moorehead Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of
USA Waste, said the acquisition will position USA Waste for what the
company expects to be a consolidation in the solid-waste industry.
</p>
<p>
   After the merger, Mr. Moorehead, 43 years old, will continue in
his posts. Envirofil's president, David SutherlandYoest, 37, will be
president and chief operating officer of the combined company. USA
Waste's chief financial officer, Earl E. DeFrates, 50, will continue
in that position.
</p>
<p>
   USA Waste shares closed at $15, up 50 cents, in composite New

@  No Way to Treat a Lady </HL>
<DD> 01/19/94 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A19 </SO>
<TXT>
<p>
   I take extreme exception to the nasty-minded comments made by
Gloria Steinem concerning the behavior of Texas Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison in your Dec. 14 page-one article "Other Nations Elect
Women to Lead Them, So Why Doesn't U.S.?" While Sen. Hutchison's
political philosophy and her legal difficulties tend to give one
pause, it is more alarming to watch Ms. Steinem, a leader of
so-called "strong" and "independent" women, fulminating in a most
undignified fashion about another strong and independent woman whose
only fault, other than those mentioned above, is of having committed
the unpardonable sin (from a feminist perspective) of having the
audacity to possess a different point of view from that of Ms.
Steinem and her devotees.
</p>
<p>
   But if one examines Ms. Steinem's malicious depiction of Sen.
Hutchison as "a female impersonator" more closely for its semantic
implications, a not-especially-original aspect becomes far more
evident, namely the traces of a far earlier -- and more pernicious
-- mindset shared by those who participated in the struggle for
women's suffrage: the putative moral superiority of women, with men
as base, sinful creatures ready to undermine all the hard work of
women at the first opportunity. Allowing women to vote, so they
said, would serve as a tempering influence upon male evil (a rather
quaint notion severely undercut by the tendency, until very
recently, toward very similar voting patterns in both men and
women). Ms. Steinem and her movement are the carriers of this
feminist argument into the present day; in suggesting that there is
something sinister in presumed political cross-dressing, Ms. Steinem
perpetuates the very myths about separate and appropriate spheres of
behaviour based solely upon gender that her ideological enemies
might use against her.
</p>
<p>
   More outrageous, however, is Ms. Steinem's belief that women
cannot trust one of their own who "looks like us and thinks like
them." What can one make of this statement, coming as it does from a
woman who, by her own admission, spent five years dating a man who
treated her badly and who would not end the relationship because she
did not want to exist without a man in her life, while
simultaneously acting as the spokeswoman for an organization
dedicated to the liberation of women? By all accounts, Sen.
Hutchison appears to have her personal life under control; at the
very least, her ideology, unlike that of Ms. Steinem, is more or
less consistent. If Ms. Steinem wants to know why many women have
recently been rejecting the label of "feminism" while still
retaining the desire to work hard and to achieve success by
"masculine" standards, one might respectfully suggest that the
redoubtable Ms. Steinem examine the not-so-subtle stench of
hypocrisy that envelops her movement.

   The suggestion that Clinton's focus on domestic concerns may mean
that women can overcome the commander in chief syndrome is nonsense.
And the debunking of the parliamentary system explanation of why
nations (including some that treat women as chattel) have chosen
women as chief executives is wishful thinking. The final issue is
not whether women can be effective mayors, governors or legislators;
it is whether they can serve as commander in chief. Can a woman send
other women's sons to die in battle? Yes. Do a whole lot of ordinary
voters think so? No. In a parliamentary system the woman selected is
personally known to those who choose her. Did any member of the
British Parliament doubt that Maggie Thatcher could send other
women's sons out to die? I think not. In a presidential system where
the commander in chief is chosen by ordinary folk in the beauty
shops and barbershops, in the bridge clubs and bars, there is great
(though mistaken) doubt. When a woman is chosen president it will be
a woman who, unlike Bill Clinton, is respected for her foreign not
her domestic policy position.

   Dollar Time Group Inc. said it ended its agreement to acquire A
Real New York Bargain, a privately held retailer based in New York,
in a transaction originally valued at $43.6 million.
</p>
<p>
   Dollar Time, a Hollywood, Fla., operator of 55 variety stores,
said the two companies disagreed on the direction of Dollar Time's
operations. Moreover, Dollar Time, in a statement, said it had
become "concerned" about the profitability of A Real New York
Bargain since the two sides agreed to join forces in November.
</p>
<p>
   As part of the original agreement, Joseph Sasson, chief executive
officer of A Real New York Bargain, and Jeffrey Klansky, president
of the retailer, became chief executive and president, respectively,
of Dollar Time, as well as directors. Yesterday, the two men
resigned their positions at Dollar Time.
</p>
<p>
   Dollar Time said Gary de Luca, 40 years old, the company's chief
operating officer, was named president.

<p>
   Anthony F. Earley Jr., credited with recouping some
losses associated with another utility's failed nuclear plant, was
named president, chief operating officer and a director of Detroit
Edison Co., effective March 1.
</p>
<p>
   Prior to becoming president in 1989 of Long Island Lighting Co.,
Hicksville, N.Y., Mr. Earley, 44 years old, served as Lilco's
general counsel and was widely credited with steering the company
through the Shoreham nuclear-plant controversy. The utility decided
to close the facility in the face of mounting controversy and
litigation. Mr. Earley helped negotiate a deal with the state that
enabled Lilco to recoup most of its investment in Shoreham through a
series of rate increases through the 1990s.
</p>
<p>
   Because of his successes at Lilco, some analysts considered him
the heir apparent to William J. Catacosinos, 63, Lilco's chairman
and chief executive.
</p>
<p>
   "I'm surprised he's leaving when he could have been CEO in a few
years," said Barry M. Abramson, an analyst with Prudential
Securities Group Inc. "Maybe he can use his expertise in nuclear
issues at the Fermi plant, which seems very important to Detroit
Edison."
</p>
<p>
   His appointment comes as Detroit Edison is assessing the damages
caused last month by a fire at its Fermi 2 nuclear power plant in
Monroe, Mich. The company has said the resulting shutdown at the
plant could affect 1994 earnings.
</p>
<p>
   John E. Lobbia, 52, who formerly held the position of Detroit
Edison president, will continue as chairman and chief executive
officer of the utility.
</p>
<p>
   A spokeswoman for Lilco said the company would announce
succession plans for Mr. Earley's position at a later date.

<p>
   McCormick & Co., Sparks, Md., said fourth-quarter net income rose
16%, due to strength in its international, industrial and packaging
operations.
</p>
<p>
   Net for the quarter ended Nov. 30 rose to $40.5 million, or 50
cents a share, from the year-earlier $35 million, or 43 cents a
share. Sales rose 1.9% to $460.8 million from $452.2 million.
</p>
<p>
   Fourth-quarter results include a charge of two cents a share, or
$1.2 million, due to an increase in the federal corporate tax rate
and post-retirement benefits.
</p>
<p>
   Bailey Thomas, the spice company's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the company had a successful year despite onion costs,
unfavorable foreign-exchange rates, and weak economic conditions in
many markets. "We expect 1994 to be another good year," he said.
</p>
<p>
   For the full year, net income fell 23% to $73 million or 89 cents
a share, from the year-earlier $95.2 million, or $1.16 a share. The
latest year includes a $26.6 million, or 33 cent a share, charge for
cumulative effects of accounting changes. Sales rose 5.7% to $1.56
billion from $1.47 billion.

@  To Acquire Pinnacle

<p>
   Mariner Health Group Inc. said it signed a
definitive agreement to acquire Pinnacle Care Corp. in a stock swap
valued at about $104 million.
</p>
<p>
   The deal would effectively double Mariner's revenue and extend
its geographic reach, the company said.
</p>
<p>
   Mariner, which expects to post revenue of about $70 million for
1993, provides subacute health care to patients who no longer
require the extensive services of an acute-care hospital but are too
sick to go home. Closely held Pinnacle, based in Nashville, Tenn.,
owns or manages 13 skilled nursing centers, operates 27 outpatient
rehabilitation clinics and contracts services to nursing homes. It's
expected to post revenue of about $70 million for 1993, Mariner
said.
</p>
<p>
   The pact is the latest in a series of combinations in the
health-care industry as providers move to position themselves for
the Clinton administration's proposed reforms. On Wednesday, Sun
Healthcare Inc., a nursing-home operator, agreed to acquire Mediplex
Group Inc., a provider of subacute care, for about $312 million in
cash and stock.
</p>
<p>
   Arthur W. Stratton Jr., chief executive officer and president of
Mariner, said the acquisition will extend Mariner's operations from
New England and mid-Atlantic states to the Southeastern region,
where Pinnacle has a strong presence.
</p>
<p>
   Under the agreement, Mariner said it will issue between 4.9
million and 5.5 million shares based on the price of Mariner's stock
before the transaction is completed. The $104 million acquisition
price is based on the $21.50 closing price of Mariner's shares in
Nasdaq trading yesterday. The company said it would issue 4.9
million shares based on that price.
</p>
<p>
   Pinnacle's management team will remain with the combined entity,
while Pinnacle's president and chief executive, J. George Harris,
will assume the positions of president and chief operating officer
of the new company. Dr. Stratton will remain chairman and chief
executive of Mariner.
</p>
<p>
   The acquisition has been approved by the boards of each company,
but still requires regulatory clearance and shareholder approvals.
The transaction is expected to be completed in April.
</p>
<p>
   Announcement of the planned acquisition was made after the stock
market closed yesterday; Mariner's shares were unchanged at $21.50.

<p>
   LONDON (AP) -- Lloyd's of London amended its offer to settle
claims from hard-hit investors, correcting a calculation error.
</p>
<p>
   The insurance market also extended its deadline for acceptance of
the 900 million-pound ($1.34 billion) settlement by two weeks to
Feb. 14.
</p>
<p>
   Lloyd's said nearly half of the 21,000 names, as Lloyd's
investors are called, will receive less than their original offer.
Some 12,000 names will receive an increased offer. Lloyd's said the
changes involve 20 billion pounds, but the total amount of the offer
remains unchanged.
</p>
<p>
   "There is no question of increasing the offer and if the offer
fails, we shall continue to help the names in settling their losses,
but it will not be in the form of another offer," Lloyd's Chairman
David Rowland said.
</p>
<p>
   Many names are facing bankruptcy as a result of insurance losses
in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Grouped into syndicates that
underwrite insurance policies, the names risked unlimited personal
financial liability in exchange for the chance to share profits.
</p>
<p>
   Many blame mismanagement and lack of regulation within the
insurance market for the losses. Members of Lloyd's who accept the
settlement offer will give up the right to bring legal action
against Lloyd's for damages.

<p>
   Toys "R" Us Inc. named Michael Goldstein chief executive officer,
ending years of speculation about who will succeed Charles Lazarus,
the toy retailer's founder and chief architect.
</p>
<p>
   Robert Nakasone, formerly vice chairman and widely regarded as
the other serious contender for the top executive's job, was named
president and chief operating officer, both new positions.
</p>
<p>
   Analysts said they expect Messrs. Goldstein and Nakasone to
continue to pursue Mr. Lazarus's strategy of developing new ways of
selling children's products, while opening stores abroad, where the
concept of high-volume, low-priced stores that keep their warehouse
inventories low hasn't spread as widely as in the U.S. Mr. Lazarus,
who continues as chairman, is expected to retain a strong role in
guiding the Paramus, N.J., concern, which revolutionized toy
retailing and now controls about a fifth of the $14 billion U.S. toy
market.
</p>
<p>
   Although the 69-year-old Mr. Lazarus has no immediate plans to
retire, the appointment clearly puts Mr. Goldstein, who retains his
title as vice chairman, first in line to become the next chairman.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Goldstein, 52, made his mark by squeezing profits out of a
mature U.S. toy-retailing market through computerintensive control
of inventory and the ordering of products. Several large toy
supermarket chains, which couldn't cut costs as effectively as Toys
"R" Us, went out of business as a result.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Goldstein also may have won the position by turning around
Kids "R" Us, the company's once-struggling children's clothing
chain, said Sean McGowan, analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co.
Although sales improvements haven't been spectacular, operating
profit at Kids "R" Us has improved in the past two years, Mr.
McGowan said. He estimates that operating profit at the division for
the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 1994, will increase about 25%.
</p>
<p>
   For the past few years, Mr. Goldstein has fielded Wall Street's
questions on financial results at the end of each quarter. "I don't
know a senior executive at any other company with as great a memory
for detail" as Mr. Goldstein, said Mr. McGowan. "You call him up and
ask him, `What about that store?' If there's an issue involved, he
knows about it."
</p>
<p>
   "Retailers have asked me who was going to get Mr. Lazarus's job.
My feeling was that if Goldstein could turn Kids "R" Us, he would
get it," Mr. McGowan said.
</p>
<p>
   Meanwhile, the international side of Toys "R" Us' business -- of
which Mr. Nakasone, 46, has been in charge -- has been a bit
disappointing. Stock Falls on Overseas Results Yesterday, Toys "R"
Us said that sales for the eight weeks ended Dec. 25, its Christmas
selling season, increased 15% to $3.41 billion from $2.96 billion
for the same period a year earlier. Sales at stores open more than a
year rose 7.4%. But in a conference call with analysts later, the
company announced that overseas sales in the holiday season at
stores open more than a year were down 2.3% in local currency and
7.9% in U.S. dollars.
</p>
<p>
   The announcement caused the company's stock to drop in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. It closed at $40, down
87.5 cents.
</p>
<p>
   Analysts attributed the sales drop to weak foreign economies,
especially those in Germany, Japan and Spain.
</p>
<p>
   Although he is in the No. 2 position, Mr. Nakasone remains key to
the company's future growth, much of which it hopes will come from
abroad. Toys "R" Us has said it has plans to increase its market
share overseas, currently 2%, to approximately what it is in the
U.S., about 20%.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Lazarus, who will no longer be involved in the day-to-day
operations of the company, will devote more time to the
international part of the business, serving as a sort of ambassador
for Toys "R" Us, said Joseph Ronning, analyst for Brown Bros.
Harriman. One of Mr. Lazarus's new chores will be to visit with
foreign government officials "to create more level playing fields
for our stores abroad," Mr. Goldstein said.
</p>
<p>
   In addition, Mr. Lazarus also will pitch in domestically by
helping the company develop new merchandising concepts, such as
creating stores within stores. Two concepts already under way are
its Books "R" Us and Lego Boutiques.
</p>
<p>
   "You can be sure that if there's a major strategic opening or
testing of a new category, Charles will have a lot of input and may
be the final arbiter," said Mr. McGowan.
</p>
<p>
   Prior to joining Toys "R" Us in 1983, Mr. Goldstein was senior
executive vice president, operations and finance, at Lerner Stores
Corp. At Toys "R" Us, he has been executive vice president, finance
and administration, and chief financial officer. In addition to
cutting costs, Mr. Goldstein has pushed for the creation of special
boutiques within stores.
