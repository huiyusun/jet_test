<HL>    Clinton's Bumpy Start Slows Business

<p>
   Many leaders of U.S. companies, large and small, are increasingly
disillusioned with the Clinton administration, saying uncertainties
about government policies are hindering business decisions.
</p>
<p>
   Some top executives who didn't like Bill Clinton in the first
place now view him as more indecisive than ever. And even former
supporters are expressing frustration. One complaint: It's politics
as usual, not business as usual.
</p>
<p>
   Despite all the criticism, the president has chalked up some
victories, leading some to hope that he is on the verge of turning
things around.
</p>
<p>
   In Congress, for instance, Mr. Clinton's deficit-reduction tax
plan, while full of compromises and scalings back, and his
legislation to reform campaign finance, also watered down, are
moving toward passage. And, of course, some captains of industry who
backed him in the campaign are either still positive or at least
hopeful.
</p>
<p>
   But most executives interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters
for this article give the president thumbs down for his performance
so far. They say his seeming unwillingness or inability to act on
major issues affecting the economy has hampered business planning. A
particular problem cited by many executives is the president's
failure to make some key appointments, leaving companies unable to
get responses to their questions or unsure of the direction
regulatory policy will take.
</p>
<p>
   "I think everyone is discouraged with what is going on in
Washington," says Kenneth Murphy, chairman, president and chief
executive officer of First Abilene Bankshares Inc., a small West
Texas bank-holding company. He adds: "It's politics as usual."
</p>
<p>
   While uncertainty over White House leadership and its impact on
the economy hasn't yet triggered any hard decisions at Hauser
Chemical Research Inc., the small Boulder, Colo., company is keeping
a close eye on a $7 million to $10 million manufacturing-plant
expansion. Although current plans are to complete the project, "I'd
say we are looking at it very closely," says CEO Dean P. Stull.
"We're probably a little more cautious about those decisions than we
would have been at the beginning of the presidency."
</p>
<p>
   Craig R. Benson, chairman of Cabletron Systems Inc., says he is a
Republican who didn't vote for Mr. Clinton and now views him as more
indecisive than before the election. "There's been an awful lot of
jockeying back and forth on issues," he says, "and that causes a lot
of wasted energy on our part." For example, says Mr. Benson, the
Rochester, N.H., maker of computer-networking products is trying to
decide about expanding or contracting its foreign factories, based
partly on U.S. tax policy. But now the administration is considering
three different versions of new tax rules on the profits of such
facilities. Mr. Benson says, "It's driving me nuts" trying to make a
decision while the administration mulls the variations.
</p>
<p>
   The Clinton administration has shown "frightening
indecisiveness," says Morton E. David, chairman and CEO of Franklin
Electronic Publishers Inc., which makes hand-held electronic books.
The executive thought Mr. Clinton had a "mastery of politics" when
he was elected, but now "I'm not sure of the president's ability as
a politician." Mr. David expects the uncertainty created by the
administration to hurt retail performance overall, even through the
fall, Franklin's biggest season. "We've been reducing our plans for
the number of products to build for sale in the Christmas season."
</p>
<p>
   Presidential priorities concern some business leaders. Mitchell
E. Kertzman, CEO of Powersoft Corp., a Burlington, Mass., software
maker, and former president of the American Electronics Association,
says: "I'm still a supporter, but I would say I'm a frustrated
supporter" of the president. Mr. Kertzman says Mr. Clinton expended
too much political capital in the first weeks of his presidency by
focusing too much on social issues -- on which, Mr. Kertzman
generally supports the Clinton policies -- and not enough on pushing
his economic plan through Congress. "Now it's going to be very hard
to get anything done," he says.
</p>
<p>
   Also concerned about priorities is Charles LaMantia, president
and chief executive of Arthur D. Little Inc., a closely held
management-consulting company in Cambridge, Mass. He is "really
quite concerned" that the Clinton administration won't be able to
accomplish any of its goals. The president's main problem, Mr.
LaMantia adds, is that "he let peripheral issues or ones of little
importance define him and weaken his leadership position." Gays in
the military, for example. And "the haircut incident was a
leadership catastrophe."
</p>
<p>
   Health-care reform is among the major concerns. In Maywood, N.J.,
Judith Fitzpatrick-Davis, president of Serex Inc., a small maker of
medical-test kits, says she regrets voting for Mr. Clinton. "In
agony, I voted for him at the last moment" in the hope that he would
bring creative solutions to the health-care crisis and other
problems. She adds that Mr. Clinton now appears incapable of making
"the hard choices" necessary.
</p>
<p>
   William W. George, president and CEO of Medtronic Inc., a
Minneapolis medicaldevice company, says of Mr. Clinton: I voted for
him, and I did it on the thought that we needed a change. But I
don't think I could vote for him now." Mr. George says he is no
longer sure where the president stands on several issues, and he has
been disappointed by the "secretive" nature of the Hillary Rodham
Clinton health-care panel's deliberations. He also decries the
administration's tough remarks about medical companies, saying "the
stock price of everything in medicine has been hit because of the
frontal assault."
</p>
<p>
   The travel and tourism industry also has been hurt badly by the
Clinton administration, asserts Robert C. Hazard Jr., chairman and
chief executive of the Choice Hotels International unit of Manor
Care Inc., Silver Spring, Md. Mr. Hazard says proposed taxes and
regulations threaten to strangle the industry. Key Posts Several
executives cited the president's failure to make important
appointments. "The fact that so many key jobs remain vacant is a
problem" says Harold "Red" Poling, chairman and CEO of Ford Motor
Co. "For example, the two key subcabinet posts relating to our
industry National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
administrator and Environmental Protection Agency assistant
administrator for air and radiation remain unfilled at a time when
major policies are under discussion."
</p>
<p>
   MCI's Mr. Roberts says, "We're sitting here in mid-June and the
president has not yet selected a head of the Federal Communications
Commission." When agencies aren't supervised, he says, "government
stops."
</p>
<p>
   To be sure, the president has his supporters. Among them is Marc
Nathanson, chairman and CEO of Falcon Cable Systems Co., a Los
Angeles-based cable-television company. "The administration's start
has been bumpy," he concedes. "But we need to give Clinton a break,
and I believe he will be resilient. He and his staff need to adjust
to the insider's games and the special-interest groups in Washington
as well as a very cynical press corps. I believe he will do it and
will go down in history as a great president."
</p>
<p>
   In any case, the clouds of criticism have a few silver linings.
</p>
<p>
   That's almost literally true for G. Michael Boswell, chairman and
CEO of Sunshine Mining Co., a Dallas-based integrated
precious-metals company. While he talks of a Clinton "debacle," he
adds: "His actions have actually helped our industry, though I don't
think that was the administration's intentions. Precious-metal
prices have strengthened in recent months, and if that continues
then we would anticipate some hiring."
</p>
<p>
   And Mr. LaMantia says Arthur D. Little "thrives on issues and
problems, so we're doing quite well."
