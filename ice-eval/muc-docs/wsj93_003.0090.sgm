<p>
   Northern Telecom Ltd. said it will report a loss for
the second quarter because of lower-than-expected sales and pricing
pressures on its public switching systems.
</p>
<p>
   The late Friday announcement, following a board meeting by the
supplier of digital telecommunications switching systems, follows a
27% drop in first-quarter net income. That quarter's disappointing
results were because of lower margins and increased research and
development and other expenses, which weren't offset by expected
revenue growth.
</p>
<p>
   "Revenues in North America and Europe, with the exception of a
few sectors, are showing slower growth than expected," Jean C.
Monty, president and chief executive, said.
</p>
<p>
   The announcement came after the stock market closed; Northern
Telecom's shares rose 37.5 cents to $37 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
</p>
<p>
   Separately, the company said it named O. Bradford Butler, former
chairman of Procter & Gamble Co., as chairman of Northern Telecom.
Mr. Butler, 69 years old, succeeds Paul Stern, who resigned as
chairman and a director.
</p>
<p>
   Dr. Stern, 54, resigned as chief executive March 1 to accept an
appointment as a visiting executive professor at the Wharton School
of the University of Pennsylvania. He became nonexecutive chairman,
and Mr. Monty was named chief executive officer. Dr. Stern's
resignation Friday as chairman "is part of an orderly transition," a
spokesman said.
</p>
<p>
   In the 1992 second quarter, Northern Telecom's net income plunged
by a third to $72.3 million, or 28 cents a share, on lower revenue
because of the sale of some businesses by its British unit and a
slowdown of equipment orders in the U.S. and Europe. Northern
Telecom is majority owned by Canada's BCE Inc.
</p>
<p>
   Weaker performance in the first half of 1993 and the outlook for
the rest of the year would result in full-year earnings being
"significantly" below 1992's results, Mr. Monty said. This reverses
a forecast by Dr. Stern, who said in January that "we still expect
to have a record year in 1993."
</p>
<p>
   The projected loss for the second quarter is mainly a reflection
of recessionary pressures in the U.S. and abroad, the spokesman
said.
