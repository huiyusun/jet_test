<p>
   Japan got some good economic news: The nation's gross
national product in the January through March quarter expanded at a
2.3% inflation-adjusted annualized rate, or 0.6% from the previous
quarter.
</p>
<p>
   That is the best performance in quite some time. Indeed, gross
domestic product, which excludes net inflows of income from
overseas, turned positive for the first time in four quarters,
expanding at an annualized rate of 2.7%, or 0.7% from the previous
quarter.
</p>
<p>
   But economists here say the economy may be headed back down in
the current quarter. They say certain unusual factors skewed the
January to March quarter's numbers, and that the period's
performance was also boosted by the government lowering its GNP
statistics for the quarter ended Dec. 31. The stronger yen, which
hurts exports, and Japan's current political turmoil are also
expected to depress the economy this summer. Some economists here
are using the term "double-dip" to describe the spring's
performance.
</p>
<p>
   "The economy remains in a bumping-along-the-bottom phase," says
Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.
"We still aren't seeing a sustained recovery. We think we have a
pretty rough summer before us."
</p>
<p>
   That said, there were some definite bright spots in the January
to March period. Personal consumption was up, as was public
investment. But the former was induced partly by desperate
manufacturers and merchants, who sought to boost results before the
March 31 closing of the fiscal year by slashing prices. Indeed, auto
sales bounced up 1.7% in March -- the first gain in nine months.
Merchants warned at the time that their efforts might have "robbed"
sales from April. And they were right: Auto sales in April sank 11%.
Other indicators, including those for capital spending, have
continued to slump in recent months.
</p>
<p>
   Public investment was up 6.5% from the previous quarter, a
reflection of the government's emergency public-spending package
passed last year. Clearly, the stimulus program is boosting the
economy, and shows the enduring strength of this nation: Unlike the
U.S., which is hobbled by its national debt, Japan has the ability
to spend its way out of recession.
</p>
<p>
   "Basically, the economy moved only because you had this strong
government spending," says Kenneth S. Courtis, economist at Deutsche
Bank AG.
</p>
<p>
   Notably, though, public investment accounts for only 7% of GNP,
compared with the consumer's share of roughly 57%. "Public
investment is up 15.5% year on year, which is pretty strong stuff,"
says Mr. Barker. "But the crucial thing is, you've got to have the
participation of the consumer" to sustain any recovery.
</p>
<p>
   Japanese officials are also bracing for the impact of the strong
yen. Although the recent political problems have brought the
Japanese currency down some, it is still roughly 10% higher against
the dollar compared with late February. The yen likely had little
effect on the January to March quarter, largely because
exchange-rate-induced price fluctuations aren't passed through the
pipeline to the consumer quite so quickly. But the effect will
probably begin to be felt this summer, and if exports are crimped,
Japan's economy could feel greater pain.
</p>
<p>
   Off-setting that pain, however, is an additional emergency
public-spending package that is coming on line. But the fall of the
Japanese government Friday, after a no-confidence vote passed the
Diet, injects additional uncertainty into the equation. Consumers
and businesses alike may choose to hunker down and curtail spending
until the political smoke clears.
