   Software Toolworks Inc. reported an unexpected
net loss of $451,000, or two cents a share, for its fourth quarter,
ended March 31, and named a new chief executive officer.
</p>
<p>
   The quarterly results were well below some analysts' estimates,
which had put net income in the quarter in the range of seven cents
a share for the maker of educational, entertainment and multimedia
software.
</p>
<p>
   Investors demonstrated their disappointment by driving Software
Toolworks' stock down $1.125, or 10%, to $9.875, in late
over-the-counter trading.
</p>
<p>
   In the year-earlier quarter, the company had a net loss of $16
million, or 63 cents a share.
</p>
<p>
   Revenue for the latest quarter rose 20%, to $27.8 million from
$23.1 million a year ago.
</p>
<p>
   Ben Z. Rose, an analyst with Hancock Institution Equity Services
Inc., said the company was hurt in the quarter by its continued
dependence on some lower-profit margin products for a substantial
portion of sales, as well as more conservative provisions for
returned products, among other things.
</p>
<p>
   For the full fiscal year, net income was $3.5 million, or 12
cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $14.5 million,
or 59 cents a share. Revenue for the full year rose about 17% to
$119.6 million from $102.6 million.
</p>
<p>
   The company also said Bob Lloyd, president and chief operating
officer, was named to the additional post of chief executive. He
succeeds Les Crane, founder of the company, who retains his position
as chairman.
</p>
<p>
   The company said Mr. Lloyd's promotion recognizes his role in
helping turn around Software Toolworks results. Mr. Crane said that
the company has "moved beyond the entrepreneurial stage" and that
Mr. Lloyd is well-equipped to chart the company's further expansion.
