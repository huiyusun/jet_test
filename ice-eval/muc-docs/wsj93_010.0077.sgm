<p>
   Hiking over a hillside in Vail, Colo., Alex Mandl, point man for
American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s push into cellular phones,
wrestled with a make-or-break chance to revive a troubled
negotiation.
</p>
<p>
   "Let's do it," Mr. Mandl said to his companion, recommending a
creative, complicated -- and potentially very costly -- scheme to
buy part of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.
</p>
<p>
   For many top executives, embracing a set of uncertainties and
plunging into a risky venture is nothing more than earning a day's
pay. But what made Mr. Mandl's decision unusual was that he is
AT&T's chief financial officer, one of the oft-maligned bean
counters traditionally cast in supporting roles during big deals.
</p>
<p>
   "That's the kind of decision that an old-style CFO would have
wrung his hands over," recalls McCaw Vice Chairman Wayne Perry, who
was Mr. Mandl's companion in Vail's woods.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Mandl is one of a growing number of chief financial officers
expanding the definition of the top financial job well beyond its
traditional numbers-crunching origin. A few finance chiefs achieved
high-profile status as fund-raising whizzes during the go-go '80s.
Then when the recession forced many companies to consider
downsizing, the intimate knowledge chief financial officers had of
every facet of operations broadened their influence.
</p>
<p>
   Now, the chief financial officer as strategic planner is
emerging. The redefined role, headhunters and management consultants
say, is born of the sluggish economic recovery. In an era of
heightened competition and hard-to-make-stick price increases, the
financial fine points of any new strategy are more crucial than ever
before. Many finance chiefs can provide that data, as well as savvy
judgment about products, marketing and other areas, the experts say.
</p>
<p>
   "CEOs have decided that constant restructuring has to take place,
and the key place where it comes together is finance," says Stephen
Scroggins, managing director of Russell Reynolds Associates, a
headhunting firm.
</p>
<p>
   At Russell Reynolds, nearly all CEOs now seeking finance chiefs
want someone with "sound business judgment . . . more than just a
CFO." And in a recent survey by headhunters Korn/Ferry
International, Fortune 100 chief financial officers almost
unanimously described themselves as "more of a partner with the CEO"
than they used to be.
</p>
<p>
   It is too soon to tell whether the new role means that more
finance chiefs are destined for the top job, headhunters say. A few
companies, like General Electric Co., have long given finance people
strategic roles. The result: "GE's {finance} people are prime
candidates for CEO positions in almost any other business," says
Glenn Van Doren, president of the Association of Executive Search
Consultants, a trade group.
</p>
<p>
   The breadth of the revolution also is uncertain. "This is a
large-company phenomenon," says Windle Priem, Korn/Ferry managing
director. He cites shareholder activism at big industrial companies
like Eastman Kodak Co. and International Business Machines Corp.
that forces CEOs to maximize earnings. "The logical place this falls
is the shoulders of the CFO," Mr. Priem says. But where
institutional investors aren't pushing for change, chief executive
officers tend to use chief financial officers mostly for backseat
number-crunching chores.
</p>
<p>
   And some finance chiefs may overestimate the degree to which
their role has changed, concludes a study of 180 medium to large
companies funded by the Financial Executives Research Board.
</p>
<p>
   The study compares responses of financial and nonfinancial
managers to questions about the changing role of finance chiefs. The
questions address the degree to which the companies' finance units
have moved from the role of "corporate policeman" to that of
"business advocate," in which financial managers offer strategy to
operating units. In general, when financial managers credit
themselves for change, nonfinancial managers in the same company
agree less than 15% of the time, co-author Stephen Jablonsky says.
</p>
<p>
   Traditionally, finance chiefs have spent 90% of their time
overseeing receivables and payables, closing accounting books,
preparing annual reports, meeting regulatory requirements,
budgeting, raising routine funds and issuing reports that measure
actual performance against projections, says Robert Howell, a New
York University professor. Projects like a stock offering or a
merger claimed remaining time.
</p>
<p>
   Finance chiefs breaking the mold tend to have a common element:
operating experience. That makes them far more able "to do the tough
things," Mr. Priem says. Most finance chiefs have traditionally come
up through a "silo" -- the narrow path from accountant to manager to
assistant controller to controller to chief financial officer. "The
old knock on a CFO was: You've never run anything," Mr. Priem says.
(Whatever their backgrounds, many finance chiefs in recent months
have been earning their stripes by paring down their own finance
operations.)
</p>
<p>
   One of numerous outsiders hired to shake up AT&T by CEO Robert
Allen, Alex Mandl arrived last year from Sea-Land Services Inc.,
where he had been CEO. In three years, Mr. Mandl had made the
money-losing CSX Corp. unit profitable by increasing revenue,
decentralizing operations and negotiating international deals.
</p>
<p>
   "Running a significant company gives you a very different
perspective on how the financial function should be performed," says
Mr. Mandl, whose earlier career at CSX and Boise-Cascade was a blend
of finance and operations. Mr. Mandl, who also runs AT&T Capital
Corp. and serves on AT&T's five-person operating committee, focuses
"on what's driving the numbers," not the numbers themselves.
</p>
<p>
   Another modern chief financial officer is Jerome York, the former
Chrysler Corp. finance chief who last month took IBM's top finance
post. A West Point and Massachusetts Institute of Technology
graduate, he began his automotive career as a General Motors Corp.
engineer. He added an M.B.A. and moved into planning at Ford Motor
Co. A mix of operating and finance jobs followed.
</p>
<p>
   As Chrysler finance chief since 1990, he helped cut $3 billion in
costs and sold more than $3 billion of non-core assets. "You just
can't mindlessly take across-the-board costs out," Mr. York says.
"You have to understand where the efficiency levers are."
</p>
<p>
   Learning IBM's "levers" is his challenge. With no background in
computers, he plans extensive visits to factories, dealers,
suppliers and customers.
</p>
<p>
   In Plano, Texas, Frito-Lay Inc. Finance Chief Michael D. White
figures he spends more than half his time on such visits to identify
fast-growing customers of the PepsiCo Inc. unit and ways to serve
them more cheaply. One night recently found him in Cincinnati dining
with merchandising people from customer Kroger Co. "In the past, the
CFO's biggest role was to finance growth, but growth used to be
easier," Mr. White says. "It's a lot more competitive out there
now."
</p>
<p>
   At UNUM Corp., a specialty insurance company, the shift to
"strategic partner" was begun 15 months ago when unanticipated
problems in several business segments surfaced, Finance Chief Rodney
Hook says. "Our CEO has told us that he's not interested in post
mortems," Mr. Hook says. "We're now looking for leading indicators,
instead of being scorekeeper."
</p>
<p>
   At AT&T, CEO Robert Allen handed Mr. Mandl the McCaw negotiating
role as part of a broader assignment to find the company's place in
wireless technology. Mr. Mandl has relished the deal makingeven the
rough spot in Vail.
</p>
<p>
   The issue last year as he hiked: McCaw's worry that it "would be
burned" for not going to the capital markets to raise money at then
favorable rates, McCaw's Mr. Perry recalls. The protracted
negotiations effectively precluded McCaw from seeking funds, because
it would have to reveal the talks.
</p>
<p>
   So McCaw proposed that AT&T agree to buy $400 million of McCaw
stock based on that day's closing price even if AT&T and McCaw
couldn't reach terms on a deal that would ultimately give AT&T
control. Mr. Mandl, whose agreement to the "put" option subsequently
was supported by AT&T's board of directors, is generally credited
with structuring the tentative $3.82 billion deal that AT&T and
McCaw announced last November. He is now hammering out operating
details.
