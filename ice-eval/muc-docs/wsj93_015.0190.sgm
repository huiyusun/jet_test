<p>
   Ukraine's Parliament Friday rejected Prime Minister
Leonid Kuchma's resignation, which he announced Thursday, and
delayed a decision on a proposal by President Leonid Kravchuk that
he become head of the government.
</p>
<p>
   Currently, the president is head of the executive branch and the
prime minister is head of government.
</p>
<p>
   Some lawmakers and government officials worry that Ukraine's
already staggering economy is headed for collapse because no one
will be in charge of the reform process.
</p>
<p>
   Friends of Mr. Kuchma say it is possible that even though
Parliament didn't accept his resignation, the prime minister will
quit his post anyway.
