   Over a century ago, the chief engineer at the British Post Office
was brought to testify before a parliamentary commission on whether
an American invention called the telephone deserved any notice. As
told by scientist and author Arthur C. Clarke, the engineer was
asked whether Alexander Bell's invention "will be of any use in
Great Britain." He replied, "No, sir. The Americans have need of the
telephone, but we do not. We have plenty of messenger boys."

<p>
   Governments have always had a weird relationship with technology.
They are typically slow to recognize the implications of
technological advances and quick to assert control over them once
they do. But the fact that Britain has scrapped its sleepy state
telecommunications system for one of the most open and progressive
private systems in Europe is cause for optimism. If the trend
continues, the world's chances greatly improve of efficiently
integrating its commerce and finances.
</p>
<p>
   Britain's fellow EC members seem to be slowly getting the
message: EC telecommunications ministers emerged from their meeting
in Brussels last week affirming their commitment to ending state
monopolies and opening Europe's $134 billion telecommunications
services industry to competition. Even France, Belgium and Spain,
which so vociferously opposed liberalizations a couple of years
back, are cautiously on board.
</p>
<p>
   This is consensus born of sheer necessity. The industry is
pervaded by monopolies and price distortions: A call from Germany to
Britain can cost up to 30% more than a call from Britain to Germany,
national rates vary widely from country to country and rates in
Europe as a whole dwarf U.S. telephone charges for the same
distances. The industry badly needs the kind of investment and
management only the private sector can bring it. A report ordered by
the European Commission last year concluded that ending cross-border
monopolies and introducing other liberalizations would lead to a
tripling of Europe's telecom services market in two decades.
</p>
<p>
   Currently, Britain is the only EC country with a truly
liberalized telecom industry. Denmark is to open its market next
year and Italy is inching toward cutting its own sky-high phone
rates. If Germany goes through with its plan to sell a 49% stake in
the state phone monopoly, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, it should
provide a push for other European governments to do the same.
</p>
<p>
   Given the benefits, 1998 seems like a particularly unambitious
deadline. At base, most European governments still retain an
instinct for nurturing industry and a dislike for foreign (that is,
American and Japanese) competition. To this end, they pointlessly
retain differing technical standards.
</p>
<p>
   Europe has clearly made strides toward overcoming the sort of
blinkered protectionism that sacrifices technological advances,
business growth and consumer interest. But it needs to go much
further. If Europe really wants to be competitive in television and
other services, it can start by letting the competition in.
</p>
<p>
   Arthur C. Clarke wrote: "As the century that saw the birth of
both electronics and optonics draws to a close, it would seem that
virtually everything we would wish to do in the field of
telecommunications is now technically possible. The only limitations
are financial, legal and political."
