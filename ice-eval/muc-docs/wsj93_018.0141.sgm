<p>
   The elderly man who opens the wooden door of
the hillside villa is stooped and shriveled. Followed by a cocker
spaniel, he shuffles onto the balcony in his slippers to admire the
view.
</p>
<p>
   It's a bucolic scene in the gathering dusk -- except for two grim
police guards in black leather jackets hovering nearby who disturb
the musings of the former Communist dictator.
</p>
<p>
   "You might have heard of a man named Todor Zhivkov who was once
an important head of state," the man says, speaking of himself in
the third person. "Now, Zhivkov is accused by his enemies and
political opponents of all sorts of earthly sins," he continues.
"What more do you want to know? I can't tell you much because my
mouth and hands are tied."
</p>
<p>
   It is hard to imagine that this frail figure was once Eastern
Europe's longest-serving and, some say, most feared Communist
leader. For 35 years, until he was toppled in 1989 by reformers who
engineered a Communist Party palace coup, Mr. Zhivkov and his
lackeys, backed by the secret police and Moscow, ruled Bulgaria.
They presided over its economic decline into a squalid Balkan
backwater.
</p>
<p>
   Today, Mr. Zhivkov, 81 years old, is under house arrest after
being found guilty of embezzlement, misappropriating state funds and
handing out apartments, holiday homes and cars to cronies for free,
or rock-bottom prices.
</p>
<p>
   He lives at his granddaughter's swanky -- by Bulgarian standards
-- suburban retreat pending appeal. While legal authorities haggle
over his sentence of seven years in prison and a $1 million fine,
Mr. Zhivkov, along with many ordinary Bulgarians, is doing some
soul-searching about socialism's legacy.
</p>
<p>
   It isn't easy to unravel. Communism's history is still cloaked in
secrecy. Disinformation is rife. How can anyone, for example, prove
that Mr. Zhivkov sucked the state coffers dry when official
documents show he earned only $80 a month as Bulgaria's head of
state and party general secretary. Not only is he innocent of
charges of having lived lavishly at the people's expense, he
grumbles, but he is also a virtual pauper.
</p>
<p>
   "Look at me -- I don't have anything," he complains, his voice
begging for sympathy. "I wear old clothes and live on a pension of
$44 a month. That's not even enough to pay for my medicine. People
say I've stashed away assets in Switzerland, and in Canada, but I
don't have one dollar, not one "lev" the Bulgarian currency. I don't
even have a bicycle."
</p>
<p>
   By all accounts, Mr. Zhivkov and his friends lived very well
while most Bulgarians barely scraped by. Seven of his estimated 30
state residences -- complete with gardens and helicopter landing
pads, and outfitted with saunas and heated indoor swimming pools --
were easily converted into tourist hotels.
</p>
<p>
   "Don't even try to compare how the Zhivkov clan and we lived,"
says Nedyalka Sandalska, vice president of the state tourist board
that claimed the properties.
</p>
<p>
   When Mr. Zhivkov fell, Bulgarians faced empty shops and an
economic crisis, but newspapers reported the existence of 1,500
"Zhivkovite" dollar millionaires.
</p>
<p>
   For decades, he governed with an iron fist, ruthlessly stamping
out all opposition whether at home or abroad: The exiled dissident
writer Georgi Markov was murdered by Bulgarian secret service agents
who jabbed him in the leg with a poisoned umbrella on a busy London
street.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Zhivkov denies all this ever happened. "We did have a police
force within the Interior Ministry, but compared to the CIA or KGB
this was just a drop in the bucket," he explains, pouring coffee
with trembling hands and passing around a plate of cookies.
</p>
<p>
   Looking back on his years in power, Mr. Zhivkov now takes credit
for being the first of the East bloc rulers to see the futility of
the system they created. After extensive travels to the West, he
argues, he realized that the apparatus of Soviet-style state
communism was doomed.
</p>
<p>
   "I was impressed with the Japanese miracle," he says. "You would
have to be a born idiot not to have realized that we the socialist
countries were being left far behind."
</p>
<p>
   Historians debate the merits of his claim. Rumor has it that he
did approach Leonid Brezhnev with such ideas, but that the Soviet
leader, now dead, simply told him to "shut up." Mr. Zhivkov says
that at first, Mikhail Gorbachev wouldn't listen either. "I knew
that if I continued, it would mean my political death," he alleges.
It was only in 1987, however, when winds of change were already
blowing, that Mr. Zhivkov won Bulgarian Politburo approval for a
plan to loosen Communist Party control and introduce market reforms.
</p>
<p>
   "I've always worked for the good of the country and to build up
society," he insists, his voice rising as he leans forward in his
chair and slices the air with his hand. "The Bulgarian people still
respect me for this. They write me letters saying how good life was
under Zhivkov and the Zhivkovists. My popularity rating is going up
and the current government's is falling."
</p>
<p>
   Not with everyone. Mr. Zhivkov faces possible charges of setting
up concentration camps from 1959 to 1962, diverting money to a
secret Soviet slush fund aiding terrorist groups, and instigating an
infamous campaign to forcefully assimilate Bulgaria's large ethnic
Turkish minority. Then there was the attempted assassination of Pope
John Paul II and suspected Bulgarian government complicity in the
murky conspiracy.
</p>
<p>
   He won't comment on these accusations. At his trial, he refused
responsibility for anything, saying that all state decisions were
taken collectively and that it is illegal to put a chief executive
on trial.
</p>
<p>
   Despite hard times under his reign, Bulgarians harbor mixed
feelings about Mr. Zhivkov's trial and house arrest. They danced in
the streets when he was overthrown; today, the mood has turned
indifferent. "At first, people wanted his head," says a local
journalist. "Now, everyone has problems just to survive. They don't
care about the past."
</p>
<p>
   Businessman Ludmil Lalov has a more cynical view: "The people in
power today are worse than Zhivkov-they're all Zhivkovs," he
asserts, referring to a wave of recent corruption scandals.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Zhivkov peers out the window through his thick glasses. "It's
quite an isolated life here," he says wistfully, folding his hands
around his belly. "I don't see many people anymore -- just my
granddaughter and the maid. I don't really understand it, but nobody
comes around to ask my advice about anything."
