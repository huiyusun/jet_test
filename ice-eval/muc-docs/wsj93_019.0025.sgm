<p>
   Members of the Midwest Stock Exchange, the nation's
second biggest stock market in terms of value of shares traded,
voted to change the name of their institution to the Chicago Stock
Exchange.
</p>
<p>
   The exchange, founded in 1882, was originally known as the
Chicago Stock Exchange. Its name was changed to the Midwest Stock
Exchange in 1949, after it acquired stock exchanges in Cleveland,
St. Louis and Minneapolis.
</p>
<p>
   Members of the exchange chose to restore the original name
because "our institution is rich in tradition, and we're proud of
our Chicago heritage," said Homer J. Livingston Jr., president and
chief executive officer of the exchange. "We operate in a very
competitive environment and want to build the identity of our
exchange locally, nationally and internationally," he said.
</p>
<p>
   The name change will be effective in July.
