   U.K. shipping, property and engineering conglomerate
Trafalgar House PLC posted a loss for the fiscal first half ended
March 31 and slashed its dividend 72%. But the company's stock rose
as it appointed a prominent Hong Kong businessman as its new
chairman.
</p>
<p>
   The British company, whose interests include the Cunard cruise
lines and the Ritz hotel of London, said Simon Keswick, the head of
Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd. will take over as chairman May 26.
Hongkong Land holds 25.1% of Trafalgar, acquired after a hostile
raid against Trafalgar in October. Hongkong Land is itself
controlled by Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., a giant Hong Kong
conglomerate.
</p>
<p>
   Hongkong Land has been shaking up Trafalgar management since
acquiring its stake.
</p>
<p>
   In trading on the London exchange, Trafalgar shares rose three
pence, or 3.3%, to 95 pence ($1.49).
</p>
<p>
   For the half, Trafalgar swung to a pretax loss of #97.6 million
($152.9 million) in the fiscal half that ended March 31, compared
with a profit of 54 million a year earlier. The loss was just
slightly larger than expected by analysts. The dividend cut to 1.25
pence from 4.40 pence, was in line with expectations.
</p>
<p>
   The pretax loss includes an exceptional charge of 120 million, to
cover a writedown of property interests along with costs of layoffs
and restructuring.
</p>
<p>
   The current acting chairman, Alan Clements, will become a deputy
chairman of the group. Among other management changes, David Gawler,
chief financial officer of Hongkong Land, will become finance
director of Trafalgar in June. Mr. Gawler succeeds John Ansdell, who
is to leave the group during the next two months along with Dermot
McDermott, chairman of the Cunard Leisure division.
