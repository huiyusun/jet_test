<p>
   Arthur Levitt Jr., a publisher and former chairman
of the American Stock Exchange, has been chosen by President Clinton
to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</p>
<p>
   The president has approved Mr. Levitt's nomination and an
announcement could come as early as this week, barring any
unforeseen developments, according to Clinton administration
sources.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Levitt emerged as the leading candidate for the post a month
ago, after passing the early favorite, Consuela Washington, a top
aide to Michigan Rep. John Dingell, the chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee.
</p>
<p>
   However, even Mr. Levitt's supporters conceded that his selection
was delayed while the White House considered the political fallout
from picking him over Ms. Washington -- who would have advanced the
president's goals of hiring women and minorities -- and conducted
thorough "vetting" of his business history.
</p>
<p>
   Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Levitt was
accused by a rival publisher of using confidential information in
the purchase of Roll Call, his successful Capitol Hill newspaper.
Mr. Levitt says there was nothing improper in his purchase of the
newspaper. The White House has acknowledged that the story caused
some pause in their process, but didn't derail him.
</p>
<p>
   Still, friends say that earlier this month, Mr. Levitt expressed
some doubts as to whether he would get the job.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Levitt's candidacy was quietly pushed by Connecticut Sen.
Christopher Dodd, who is chairman of the Senate banking subcommittee
on securities. Mr. Levitt also helped raise $3.5 million at a New
York fund-raiser for President Clinton last fall, even though he
didn't support him in the primaries.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Levitt comes from a political family. His father, Arthur
Levitt Sr., was state comptroller in New York from 1955 through
1978, and holds the record for the most votes ever received by a
state politician.
</p>
<p>
   As SEC chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr. would succeed Richard Breeden,
a Republican appointee who is stepping down a few months before his
term ends. Mr. Levitt, who is 62 years old, will join three SEC
commissioners who have yet to turn 40. A fourth commission seat is
vacant.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Breeden, who had originally announced that he would step down
as chairman on April 15, is staying on through next week. He is said
to be mulling several jobs, including offers from law firms.
</p>
<p>
   Of the SEC actions pending this year, few are more anticipated
than the commission's Market 2000 report, an exhaustive study of the
future of the U.S. capital markets. The report, originally slated
for release this spring, is now expected to be released in the fall.
</p>
<p>
   SEC staff members working on the report said the absence of a new
chairman didn't delay the report's release, but they indicated that
they would like to have the new chairman's blessing on the report.
</p>
<p>
   On a broader scale, the new SEC chairman will also inherit
important groundwork laid by Mr. Breeden for opening the U.S.
securities markets to foreign companies. The globalization of the
markets is important to the big New York exchanges as well as the
regional stock exchanges.
</p>
<p>
   "We're not just competing in the U.S. today but around the
world," said Leopold Korins, head of the Pacific Stock Exchange.
"This is a period in our history when I would like to think that the
chairman of the SEC would have a very strong vision of what the
marketplace will look like in the next few years."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Korins, who served on the disciplinary panel of the American
Stock Exchange, said he didn't have many direct dealings with Mr.
Levitt.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Levitt, who lives and works in New York, couldn't be reached
for comment last night. The nomination would require Senate
confirmation.
