   Existing single-family home sales slipped 2.9% in March to their
lowest level since last June, as flooding and snowstorms hammered
the nation's housing markets.
</p>
<p>
   The existing sales fell to an annualized, seasonally adjusted
pace of 3,360,000 during the month from a revised pace of 3,460,000
in February, according to the National Association of Realtors. The
March pace was also off from the year-earlier rate of 3.5 million.
</p>
<p>
   Housing analysts said that underlying demand remains strong,
however, and that sales have picked up briskly through many parts of
the country since a blizzard slammed into the Eastern seaboard last
month and effectively shut down sales for several days.
</p>
<p>
   Indeed, the Mortgage Bankers Association's weekly index of home
loan purchase volume is running about 61% above normal as buyers
flock into the market due to increased affordability from a renewed
drop in residential mortgage rates to their lowest level in 20
years. The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage fell to 7.46% Friday from
7.50% the previous week, according to a survey of lenders by HSH
Associates Inc., a Butler, N.J., mortgage publishing firm.
</p>
<p>
   "We're seeing singles, childless couples and families with kids,
all trying to get the best buy with the lowest rate," said William
S. Chee, president of the Realtors' trade group, based in
Washington, D.C., and a Honolulu broker. "Both entry-level and
trade-up segments of the market are busy."
</p>
<p>
   John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the trade group, added that
housing may be one of the brightest points of the economy. "The
economy will continue to struggle but move forward, bolstered
considerably by a strong housing industry," Mr. Tuccillo said. "Low
rates, better conditions for trade-up buyers and an ample supply of
first-time buyers will make the market sing into the summer."
</p>
<p>
   Richard J. Loughlin, president and chief executive of Century 21
Real Estate Corp., the Irvine, Calif., brokerage unit of
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., said that his company's sales
nationwide surged 35% in March from February and that April sales
are continuing strong. He said that his brokers report pickups in
activity throughout the country, and that even hardest-hit Southern
California shows a sign of life.
</p>
<p>
   Steven Cochrane, senior economist at Regional Financial
Associates, a West Chester, Pa., consulting firm, said the housing
markets are strongest in what he describes as a "Southern crescent"
that begins in North Carolina, extends to the Gulf Coast, west to
Texas and then up to Denver.
</p>
<p>
   "That's where most of the employment growth is occurring right
now," Mr. Cochrane said. "The residential realestate markets have
started to bounce back."
</p>
<p>
   The stable Midwest has led the housing recovery, and in March
existing-home sales there rose 3.3% from February. Sales in the East
and South were off, influenced both by bad weather and continued
economic sluggishness in the Northeast. The West remained moribund
in March, as California's huge housing market suffered from both
unusually rainy weather and continued recession.
</p>
<p>
   California's existing-home sales in March fell 7.9% to an
annualized, seasonally adjusted pace of 384,220 from 416,950 in
February, according to the California Association of Realtors.
</p>
<p>
   Like the National Association of Realtors, most of the sales
measured by the California trade group are those that closed in the
month. A better leading indicator of housing sales is the mortgage
banker's index of loan purchase volume.
