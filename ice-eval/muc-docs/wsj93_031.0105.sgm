   Spelling Entertainment Group Inc. named H. Wayne
Huizenga, chairman and chief executive officer of Blockbuster
Entertainment Corp., following Blockbuster's recent purchase of a
controlling interest in Spelling.
</p>
<p>
   He succeeds investor Carl H. Lindner, whose closely-held American
Financial Corp. had held a 48.2% stake in Spelling that Blockbuster
acquired last month in a $140 million stock swap. Combined with
Spelling shares previously acquired by Blockbuster, the Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., video store chain now holds a 53.8% stake in
Spelling, a producer and distributor of films and television
programs, including the current Fox shows "Beverly Hills 90210" and
"Melrose Place." Television producer Aaron Spelling, the company's
founder, was named vice chairman and a member of the board's
executive committee.
</p>
<p>
   Steven R. Berrard, Blockbuster's vice chairman, president and
chief operating officer, was named president, chief executive and a
director of Spelling, succeeding Mr. Lindner's son S. Craig Lindner,
who remains a board member.
