   Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner Inc.'s chairman, chief
executive officer and president, collected 1992 compensation of $3.6
million, up about 29% from 1991.
</p>
<p>
   According to the big entertainment and publishing company's 1992
proxy statement, Mr. Levin received about $1.1 million in salary and
a bonus of $2.5 million. In addition, Mr. Levin exercised options on
102,764 shares for a paper profit of $2.1 million.
</p>
<p>
   The company cited several factors for the increase, including the
rise in the company's stock price last year, debt restructuring and
completion of a strategic alliance with Toshiba Corp. and Itochu
Corp., formerly C. Itoh & Co. that resulted in a $1 billion
investment. Moreover, Mr. Levin, though filling the post of co-chief
executive officer in 1992, served as the company's sole top officer
for most of the year because of the cancer-related illness of the
late Steven J. Ross, co-chief executive and chairman.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Levin has since been named to the company's top three posts.
