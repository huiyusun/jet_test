<p>
   Rupert Murdoch took control of the New York Post, but
failed to convince some analysts he is doing the right thing.
</p>
<p>
   At the same time, it appears Mr. Murdoch will get the federal
approval he needs to own both a newspaper and a television station
in New York.
</p>
<p>
   A federal bankruptcy court judge accepted a plan under which Mr.
Murdoch, chairman of media concern News Corp., took management
control of the tabloid newspaper from court-designated owner Abraham
Hirschfeld. The Post will now be run by a News Corp. subsidiary
while Mr. Murdoch negotiates with union workers and federal
regulators to buy back the Post.
</p>
<p>
   Spirits were high at the paper after a newsroom appearance by Mr.
Murdoch, who owned the paper from 1976 to 1988. But they fell after
it was made public that Post editor Pete Hamill would be replaced
with Ken Chandler, the executive producer of Fox Broadcasting's "A
Current Affair." Mr. Chandler has worked as editor of News Corp.'s
Boston Herald and as managing editor at the Post during Mr.
Murdoch's earlier tenure.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Murdoch also named Patrick Purcell, chief executive officer
of News Corp.'s News America's Publishing unit, as the Post's new
publisher. Mr. Purcell will remain publisher and president of the
Boston Herald.
</p>
<p>
   Under terms of the management contract, Mr. Murdoch will operate
the Post for at least 60 days, covering all of its operating
expenses. While the paper is said to have advertising and
circulation revenue of close to $1 million a week, it is estimated
to have a weekly operating deficit of as much as $300,000.
</p>
<p>
   Several media analysts have found Mr. Murdoch's interest in the
Post puzzling, and at least one firm, Alex. Brown & Sons, lowered
its recommendation of News Corp.'s American depositary shares to
"neutral" from "buy." Alex. Brown analyst Drew Marcus largely
attributed the move to a "cold streak" at the box office for Fox
films, but said he also "questioned the logic behind buying the New
York Post." In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, News Corp.'s American depositary shares were unchanged at
$41.25.
</p>
<p>
   As Mr. Murdoch negotiates with the paper's unions and creditors,
he must work to win a waiver from Federal Communications Commission
regulations that bar cross-ownership of media properties.
</p>
<p>
   While officials have hinted at it, FCC Chairman James Quello
indicated the agency is likely to approve Mr. Murdoch's request for
a waiver of FCC rules that bar common ownership of a newspaper and
television station in the same market. "It looks very good here," he
said. Mr. Murdoch was forced by Congress to sell the Post after
acquiring New York's WNYW-TV in 1986. This time, key lawmakers,
including Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who
is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, have said they don't
plan to oppose joint ownership.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Murdoch, however, ran into spirited opposition from Hispanic
groups. Rainbow Broadcasting Inc. -- a group of Los Angeles-area
Hispanic broadcasters and community leaders who have been fighting
Fox Television Stations Inc.'s application to renew its FCC license
for KTTV-TV in Los Angeles since 1988 -- and the New York chapter of
the National Hispanic Media Coalition, said they would oppose Mr.
Murdoch's efforts to obtain the FCC waiver.
</p>
<p>
   In a joint statement, the two groups said they will fight the
waiver. They claim the lengthy litigation in the KTTV-TV case has
shown a "pattern of misconduct" by Fox and Mr. Murdoch, and that
joint ownership would lead to unjustifiable concentration of media
ownership in the New York market. In addition, the groups said that
Mr. Murdoch's efforts to win "advance approval for an FCC waiver
appear to have compromised the integrity of the commission's
regulatory procedures."
