   Earth Technology Corp. expects to post net income of between
$380,000 and $430,000, or 12 cents to 14 cents a share, for its
second quarter, ended Feb. 26, Creighton Early, chief financial
officer, said.

<p>
   That compares with a net loss of $638,000, or 22 cents a share,
in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the latest quarter rose to
around $15.5 million from $11.7 million, Mr. Early said in an
interview in Long Beach, Calif.
</p>
<p>
   For the six months, the company will post net income of between
$750,000 and $800,000, or 24 cents to 26 cents a share, on revenue
of about $30 million, he said. For the first six months of fiscal
1992, it had a net loss of $576,000, or 19 cents a share, on revenue
of $25.7 million.
</p>
<p>
   Diane Creel, recently promoted to chief executive officer, said
the return to profitability reflects the success of the company's
"back-to-basics" strategy focusing on its core government and
commercial hazardous-waste consulting businesses. The company
floundered in recent years when its diversification efforts soured
as the recession hit.
