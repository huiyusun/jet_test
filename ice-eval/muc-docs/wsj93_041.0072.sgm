   The New York Post has returned to the brink of
extinction.
</p>
<p>
   The ailing tabloid filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday, on
the same day it failed to publish any editions, its new owner fired
then rehired staffers, and a would-be rescuer continued his fight to
step in.
</p>
<p>
   Angry staffers thwarted the publication of the 192-year-old
tabloid paper on Monday, after learning the new court-designated
owner, Abraham Hirschfeld, planned immediate firings of more than
200 employees. That marked one of the few times in its history that
the Post failed to publish. The Post plans to publish today, and if
it does, Post insiders said it would carry stories attacking Mr.
Hirschfeld.
</p>
<p>
   Earlier yesterday, many Newspaper Guild union members were
notified they were being fired, but by late afternoon Post insiders
said most of those firings were rescinded. It was unclear whether
that included several top managers. Neither Mr. Hirschfeld nor the
managers could be reached for comment.
</p>
<p>
   In U.S. bankruptcy court, meanwhile, Steven Hoffenberg, until
last week a bidder for the Post, and Post creditors were petitioning
to overturn the planned sale to Mr. Hirschfeld. Mr. Hirschfeld's own
commitment came into question yesterday, as wire services quoted the
real estate developer as saying he was more interested in buying the
Post's building rather than the newspaper itself. He also was quoted
as saying he might step aside if Gov. Mario Cuomo came forward with
a new group of investors.
</p>
<p>
   Yesterday, the Post filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
federal court in New York, at the direction of Mr. Hirschfeld with
the approval of current owner Peter Kalikow. Post sources said the
filing was aimed at insulating the paper from claims by Mr.
Hoffenberg, who may try to collect on $6 million he already had
invested in the newspaper. Mr. Hoffenberg, chairman of Towers
Financial Corp., had originally won the right to buy the paper but
couldn't close the deal because of continuing trouble with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
