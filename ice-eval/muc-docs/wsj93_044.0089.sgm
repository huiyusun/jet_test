   Advanced Medical Inc. announced changes in top
officers, said it expects to take a $1.5 million pretax
first-quarter charge for certain cost-cutting steps, and reported
fourth-quarter net income of $2.5 million compared with a
year-earlier loss.
</p>
<p>
   The company, whose main operating unit, IMED Corp., is a major
producer of medical intravenous equipment, said Henry Green, who was
president and chief operating officer, resigned those posts and has
been succeeded temporarily by Stanley S. Anders III, who retains
earlier responsibilities as chief financial officer.
</p>
<p>
   Advanced Medical said Mr. Green will remain a director and a
consultant to the company. Mr. Green said he resigned to save the
company money to eliminate duplication in management of the parent
and the unit.
</p>
<p>
   Advanced Medical also said Jeffry M. Picower was elected to the
board and named a co-chairman with Richard D. Propper, who has been
the company's chairman. Mr. Picower, who is chairman and chief
executive officer of Monroe Systems for Business Inc., had held the
same position in 1988 and 1989 with a predecessor company of
Advanced Medical, the company said.
</p>
<p>
   Advanced Medical said it expects to take its $1.5 million pretax
charge in connection with steps that the company believes will save
about $3 million in annual expenses compared with last year.
</p>
<p>
   The company said its fourth-quarter net income equaled about 14
cents a share. The net loss in the 1991 fourth quarter totaled $1.1
million, or 12 cents a share, including $1.2 million in one-time
charges for the early extinguishment of debt. Revenue rose 13%, to
$40.9 million from $36.4 million.
