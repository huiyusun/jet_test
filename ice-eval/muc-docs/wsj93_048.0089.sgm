   ENTERTAINMENT: Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. and CBS Inc. are
expected to announce plans today to produce and distribute free
videotapes containing previews of future CBS TV programs, movies and
music releases. The so-called Hot Picks videotapes are to be
distributed nationwide through Blockbuster's 3,127 video-rental
stores beginning in June. The company has tested the concept in
Memphis, Tenn., New York and Boston for the past six months, said
Steven Berrard, vice chairman of Blockbuster.

   PUBLISHING: Price Stern Sloan Inc. said its president and chief
executive officer, Morton Mint, 47, had left the company. It
wouldn't say why he relinquished the post; he joined the company
last April. Mr. Mint had been president and chief executive of
Viking/Penguin U.S.A. The chief executive post will be resumed by L.
Lawrence Sloan, the company's chairman, until directors can choose a
successor.
