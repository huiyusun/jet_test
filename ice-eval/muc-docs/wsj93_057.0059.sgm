   The New York Daily News named Lou Colasuonno to be
editor of the newspaper. Mr. Colasuonno, 44 years old, was editor of
the New York Post, the longtime rival of the Daily News.
</p>
<p>
   The Daily News was recently purchased by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, a
real estate developer and publisher of the magazine U.S. News &
World Report.
</p>
<p>
   Two other top editors at the Post, managing editor James Lynch
and metropolitan editor Richard Gooding, also quit to join the News,
Reuters reported. It said the move stunned reporters at the Post,
which only eight days ago came within minutes of shutting its doors
after 192 years of continuous publishing.
</p>
<p>
   Steven Hoffenberg, the businessman who took over the Post and
promised to keep it going while he completed its purchase, vowed to
sue the News for poaching his staff, Reuters said.
</p>
<p>
   The news service said that also leaving was the Post's lead
columnist, Mike McAlary, who last week wrote that he was willing to
give Mr. Hoffenberg a chance.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Colasuonno is known for attention-grabbing stories and page
one headlines. He called quitting the Post the hardest thing he ever
did, according to Reuters. "This is the best paper in town because
of the people in this room," he said in a newsroom speech before
breaking down in tears. Mr. Colasuonno didn't give details on why he
was leaving.
