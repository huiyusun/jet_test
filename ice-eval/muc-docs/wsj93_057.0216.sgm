   Hoping to move beyond the controversies that
clouded his first days in office, President Clinton spent the
weekend conferring with his cabinet and plans to spend this week
nailing down the initial details of his economic plan.
</p>
<p>
   The weekend retreat at Camp David was designed to get the cabinet
working together to make progress on Mr. Clinton's top priorities:
economic revitalization, health care overhaul, national service, and
revising campaign-finance and lobbying laws. These goals were
hindered by clashes over the president's ill-fated selection of Zoe
Baird for attorney general and his stunted attempt to allow
homosexuals to serve in the military.
</p>
<p>
   The president's aides said their efforts this week will be
devoted largely to deciding what components to include in Mr.
Clinton's economic plan, which is set to be unveiled Feb. 17. It
will be composed of three parts: short-term economic stimulus in the
form of new spending, long-term investment, which will include tax
breaks, and a big package of spending cuts and tax increases to
reduce the budget deficit over time.
</p>
<p>
   Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton hasn't yet chosen an appointee for
attorney general since Mrs. Baird withdrew her name, and aides said
finding a replacement could take as long as a week or more. U.S.
District Judge Rya Zobel of Boston has been interviewed for the job,
however, and the president is also said to be considering several
others, including Andrea Ordin, a former prosecutor in Los Angeles,
U.S. Appeals Judge Richard Arnold of Little Rock, Ark., and U.S.
District Judge Abner Mikva of Washington.
</p>
<p>
   Officials said the No. 2 and 3 posts under the attorney general
are close to being filled: Charles Ruff, a former Watergate
prosecutor and former Justice Department aide, will likely be chosen
for deputy attorney general, and Webster Hubbell, a friend of Mr.
Clinton and former law partner of Mrs. Clinton, is expected to be
picked for associate attorney general.
</p>
<p>
   Separately, President Clinton nominated John Rollwagen, the
chairman and chief executive officer of Cray Research Inc., as the
No. 2 Commerce Department official. Mr. Rollwagen said he wants to
push the Clinton administration to aggressively confront U.S.
trading partners such as Japan to open their markets, particularly
for high-tech industries.
</p>
<p>
   In a letter sent throughout the Eagan, Minn.-based company on
Friday, Mr. Rollwagen warned: "Whether we like it or not, our
country is in an economic war; and we are at a key turning point in
that war." He added, "The next few years will tell if the U.S.
continues to play a leadership role in the new information age, or
whether we will recede into a secondary role behind the Japanese and
the Europeans and Koreans and Taiwanese and others."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Rollwagen is on record as seeking to open Japanese markets.
Last year, he publicly blasted the Japanese for giving a
multimillion-dollar supercomputer contract to NEC Corp., a huge
Japanese electronics company, instead of to Cray. In congressional
testimony, he protested that NEC was picked for "political, not
technical reasons," and said that the decision "confirms our belief
that the Japanese market continues to be manipulated."
</p>
<p>
   Cray Research said it has appointed John F. Carlson, its
president and chief operating officer, to succeed Mr. Rollwagen.
</p>
<p>
   Meanwhile, the administration is recruiting Rufus Yerxa for the
No. 2 position in the U.S. trade representative's office, according
to trade officials. Mr. Yerxa has represented the U.S. in
discussions to open European and Japanese markets.
</p>
<p>
   And Mexico-born political economist, Raul Hinojosa Ojeda, is
being considered for an assistant trade representative post. Mr.
Hinojosa, a University of California, Los Angeles, professor with
extensive Mexican experience, would help negotiate an environmental
and labor pact to supplement the North American Free Trade Accord.
</p>
<p>
   In his academic writings, Mr. Hinojosa has pushed for a North
American adjustment fund and development bank similar to those used
in the European Community to aid poorer nations and Eastern Europe.
