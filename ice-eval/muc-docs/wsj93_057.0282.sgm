   Elk Grove, Calif. -- Right here, at the flat-as-prairie southern
frontier of Sacramento, Peter Calthorpe is trying to earn a spot in
the annals of suburban history. After philosophizing for more than a
decade about the senselessness of current planning standards, this
San Francisco-based visionary is building a "pedestrian pocket"
called Laguna West. And he just might set off a wave of
neotraditional planning, for better and for worse.
</p>
<p>
   Just like Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, the Miami
planners who designed Seaside, Fla., Mr. Calthorpe proclaims that
new subdivisions can fight pollution and acquire a sense of place
with tight grids of thin streets, mixed housing types and easily
accessible parks, stores and mass transit. But unlike his East Coast
counterparts, he does not impose rigidly regionalist and costly
architectural standards that can cause mass-market architects to
produce half-kitsch-half-arty mutants.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Calthorpe instead lets developers build what they like
(provided porches cover facades and garages are tucked to the side
or around back). But he strictly controls public amenities, thereby
producing a mix of unabashedly lowbrow architecture with clever
street details and layouts.
</p>
<p>
   Laguna West's developer, Phil Angelides (chairman of California's
Democratic Party), planned in 1989 to slather the site with the
usual confusing spaghetti-snarl of streets. But soon after local
officials approved his plan, he fell for the charms of Mr.
Calthorpe's spiels and renderings. On paper, Laguna West is an
exquisite revival of beaux-arts planning: a symmetrical quilt of
brightly colored squares (each hue signifying a different use or
population density), with alleys, sidewalks and vintage-style lamp
posts set along byways and grand boulevards, and with 38 acres of
park around a 73-acre manmade lake studded with inhabited islands.
</p>
<p>
   Currently the thousand-acre site is two-thirds raw dirt and
one-third park, town hall, amphitheater, lake and one hundred
single-family homes that are all hilarious. Norman, craftsman,
colonial, Queen Anne, Tuscan, Tudor and Egyptian details pop up
wherever they can; overgrown window sills resemble fat lips and
almost bump into adjacent porch rails; perfunctory front porches can
barely shelter single chairs. (Like low-end Victoriana, this stuff
could take up to eight decades to acquire dignity and charm -- but
at least it will never put on elitist airs.)
</p>
<p>
   The public spaces are less aggressive: In fact, the collaboration
of Mr. Calthorpe and landscape architect Ken Kay seems rather
wishy-washy, torn between modernity and nostalgia. The town hall is
just a dusty-peach-and-gray concrete box with mint timber trim, the
amphitheater alongside it a simple grass bowl, the park land a lawn
strip flanked by poplar and oak trees and zigzagging garden beds,
the waterfront tamely furnished with neo-Victorian benches and peach
light fixtures.
</p>
<p>
   Clearly, however, mainstream America could thrive in this
setting. Almost every new home for sale in the Sacramento region
bears a blatant resemblance to Laguna West's motley assortment, down
to the turned-baluster interior stair rails and the improbable
display ledges perched eight feet up the walls of
cathedral-ceilinged living rooms. "It really is cute here, and the
price was right," Rita Livingston, a recent Laguna West homebuyer,
told me.
</p>
<p>
   My own favorite parts of Laguna West are the subtle
underpinnings: the neverending sidewalks; the numerous gate-free
entrances and cross-complex thoroughfares (you rarely feel
disoriented or walled in); the street trees in concrete wells that
protrude three feet into the roadways (to prevent drag racing but
not discourage curbside parking); the tree codes that could smooth
out the architectural chaos. (Mr. Kay specified single species for
each roadside: only live oaks on Gropius Street, for instance, and
only bloodgood sycamores along Mumford Court -- that's right, the
streets ambitiously bear the names of past architectural masters.)
</p>
<p>
   All of these twists in the neotraditional canon are relatively
easy to copy, and ideally they will be, as the trend takes over the
postrecession landscape. (There's even talk these days of
retrofitting existing communities and malls along neotraditional
lines -- can't you just imagine cruising through orchards at the
feet of Safeways?)
</p>
<p>
   But if you find the whole neotraditional prospect disturbingly
anticity (as I still sometimes do), you will be pleased to learn
that Laguna West feels the need to fill its brochures with
references to the ways porches and friendly sidewalks might deter
street evils. Yes, it may look peaceful here, but Laguna West's town
hall nonetheless offers children courses in "Stranger Danger" and in
self-fingerprinting.
</p>
<p>
   Somehow it's reassuring to know that, while we are building and
escaping to unprecedentedly sanitized versions of urbanism, we're
not leaving behind our urban angst.
