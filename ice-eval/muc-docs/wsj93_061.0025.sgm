   The choice of a successor to James Robinson III as
American Express Co.'s chairman and chief executive officer appears
headed for a showdown.
</p>
<p>
   The company's five-person search committee is meeting here today
to decide whom to recommend to the 19-member board, which meets
Monday. Two committees made up of 14 directors, some of whom are
also on the search committee, will be meeting today as well.
</p>
<p>
   Two leading outside candidates are said to be chief executives of
major consumer-products concerns. But Mr. Robinson is backing Harvey
Golub, American Express's 53-year-old president.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Robinson has declined to comment. But according to one person
close to the situation, Mr. Robinson believes he has enough support
on the board to make Mr. Golub chief executive under an arrangement
that would let Mr. Robinson remain chairman for an indefinite
period.
</p>
<p>
   "Jimmy thinks he has between 12 and 14 votes, and all he needs is
10 votes," the individual said. "Throughout the search process, he
has been working like hell to line up board votes" for Mr. Golub.
Mr. Robinson's goal has been "to make sure that it isn't an
outsider" who succeeds him as chief executive, the individual added.
</p>
<p>
   But other people close to the board say Mr. Robinson may not have
enough support to push through his own choice of sucessor. For one
thing, even if he does get 12 to 14 votes, the board may want the
decision to be nearly unanimous. Although most directors remain
loyal to Mr. Robinson, at least five are believed to be opposed to
Mr. Golub.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Robinson may simply find himself bargaining for either a
future role for himself at the company or a promise that Mr. Golub
will have a shot at the CEO spot within five years.
</p>
<p>
   There is likely to be at least informal discussion of the CEO
issue as board members gather in New York today to discuss 1992
financial results.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Robinson apparently lacked enough votes to anoint Mr. Golub
when the succession drama began last fall. At a supper meeting the
night before the board met in September, Mr. Robinson, 57, told
board members he didn't plan to stay in his post past the age of 60.
Directors then surprised Mr. Robinson by demanding his departure in
the near future.
</p>
<p>
   Directors are eager to avoid a repetition of the divisive
September meeting, when sides were drawn over whether to seek an
immediate successor to Mr. Robinson.
</p>
<p>
   The board decided to begin its search, including interviewing
outside candidates, because it wanted to quell a possible coup led
by one outside director. Rawleigh Warner Jr., the retired chairman
of Mobil Corp., is said to have proposed Mr. Robinson's immediate
ouster and, according to an article in the New Yorker magazine this
week, his replacement by an interim executive committee of
directors. The person close to the situation said those reports are
accurate. Mr. Warner couldn't be reached to comment.
</p>
<p>
   Though the identities of the two leading outside candidates are
unknown, a number of names have popped up on Wall Street and among
executive recruiters as fitting the search committee's criteria: a
seasoned consumer-products executive who has led his company through
significant challenges. Among them are Reuben Mark, chairman and CEO
of Colgate-Palmolive Co.; John Sculley, chairman and CEO of Apple
Computer Inc.; Robert L. Crandall, chairman, president and CEO of
AMR Corp.; William D. Smithburg, chairman and CEO of Quaker Oats
Co.; John H. Bryan, chairman and CEO of Sara Lee Corp.; and Roger A.
Enrico, chairman of PepsiCo Inc.'s Worldwide Foods business.
</p>
<p>
   Tuesday, Mr. Enrico issued an internal staff memo denying that he
was a candidate. A Sara Lee insider said there was "no way" that Mr.
Bryan would accept the helm of American Express. Through a
spokesman, Mr. Sculley said he is happy at Apple and has no plans to
leave. Mr. Crandall, through a spokesman, said, "There is absolutely
no substance to that speculation."
</p>
<p>
   A Quaker Oats spokesman said, "We're just simply not going to
comment" on speculation about Mr. Smithburg and American Express.
And Mr. Mark at Colgate declined to comment, citing company policy
about discussing matters at other companies.
</p>
<p>
   Contenders for CEO jobs almost never concede that they're under
consideration because they could jeopardize their current position,
executive recruiters say.
</p>
<p>
   American Express hired executive recruiters Heidrick & Struggles
Inc. to assist in its search. Gerard Roche, the firm's chairman,
said Mr. Robinson and Richard M. Furlaud, an outside director and
former president of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., "are in control of the
process" as co-chairmen of the search committee. The search for Mr.
Robinson's successor "should be reaching a conclusion within a
reasonable time," Mr. Roche said, but he declined to comment
further.
</p>
<p>
   But while American Express personnel and its major investors are
eager for the issue to be resolved, an announcement won't
necessarily follow Monday's meeting.
</p>
<p>
   "We may simply evaluate and then give more direction to the
search committee," said one director, who asked not to be named.
</p>
<p>
   Silence on the issue beyond Monday, however, would indicate to
many that Mr. Golub is out of the running. "How much time do they
need to size him up?" asked a former executive of the company. The
former executive said a number of directors were favorably impressed
with Mr. Golub at the November board meeting. There, he and Kenneth
Chenault, head of the U.S. card operations of Travel Related
Services, described progress that had been made in persuading
American Express customers to use their credit cards more
frequently.
