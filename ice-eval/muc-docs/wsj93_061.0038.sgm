<p>
   The bond market didn't seem as enthralled with
Inauguration Day as were many people in the nation's capital and
most Treasury prices dropped slightly.
</p>
<p>
   The benchmark 30-year bond, for example, dropped more than 1/4
point to 103 15/32 to yield 7.33%, up from 7.30% on Tuesday. The
10-year note dropped less than 1/4 point to 98 11/32 to yield 6.59%,
up from 6.57%. But the two-year note rose less than 1/8 point to 100
15/32 to yield 4.35%, down from 4.39%.
</p>
<p>
   "Mr. Clinton's inauguration did not have an effect on the market"
yesterday, said Bryan R. Scarfone, head of government trading at SBC
Government Securities, a unit of Swiss Bank. Traders said that the
bond markets have adopted a wait-and-see attitude with regard to the
new president and are unlikely to react until he starts announcing
the details of his economic plan.
</p>
<p>
   Bond investors will be watching for clues as to how President
Clinton will fulfill campaign promises to help revive the economy
while reducing the federal budget deficit at the same time.
Investors seem to have factored in the likelihood of a $20 billion
to $30 billion short-term spending package, though President Clinton
has made no formal announcement of such a package.
</p>
<p>
   The new president will have a chance today to make at least a
symbolic show of his commitment to reducing the federal budget
deficit, a big concern of the bond markets. President Clinton must
decide by today whether to adjust deficit ceilings written into the
1990 deficit-reduction law, thus rendering the ceilings meaningless,
or leave the ceilings unchanged and risk across-the-board spending
cuts in the future.
</p>
<p>
   The decision is considered more symbolic than concrete because it
wouldn't involve much money. Nevertheless, the bond markets will be
watching closely because it will be an early indicator of where the
president stands on the issue of deficit reduction.
</p>
<p>
   The 1990 budget law did away with such fixed ceilings for the
deficit through the end of this fiscal year but imposes them again
for fiscal 1994, which begins Oct. 1, and the following year. The
system of deficit limits and automatic spending cuts was originally
established by the 1985 Gramm-Rudman law.
</p>
<p>
   The 1990 budget law gives Mr. Clinton a one-time chance to adjust
the ceilings to reflect changes in the economy and technical
estimates that have occurred since January of last year. His
transition aides have said that he will probably make the
adjustment, thus making the ceilings irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
   "More generally, the current budget rules are likely to be
reworked to reflect the changed budget priorities Clinton brings to
the presidency," commented Shearson Lehman Brothers political
analyst Thomas D. Gallagher in a company newsletter. "Aspects like
the discretionary spending targets, and possibly the firewalls
between defense and nondefense spending for fiscal 1993, will be
altered."
</p>
<p>
   Early trading in the Treasury market yesterday was a continuation
of the recent trend where longer maturities outperformed short and
intermediate-term issues. However, the buying that had been helping
longer issues in the past few sessions faded, resulting in a modest
correction by day's end.
</p>
<p>
   Among the positions being unwound were what is known as curve
flattening trades. When the difference between yields on long-term
securities and short-term securities narrows, that is known as a
flattening yield curve.
</p>
<p>
   Traders who had sought to profit from that movement had bought
the 30-year Treasury bond and sold Treasurys with shorter
maturities, but a few reversed themselves yesterday.
</p>
<p>
   The spread between the two-year note and the 30-year bond widened
slightly to 2.97 percentage points by late in the day. The spread
had narrowed sharply by 0.14 percentage point Tuesday to finish at
2.94 percentage points.
</p>
<p>
   President Clinton's inaugural address yielded no new specifics,
which appeared to disappoint some in the market and may have added
to the selling at the long end. "It was basically a cheerleading
speech, but the market was hoping for something more than that, and
it didn't happen," said Michael Strauss, chief economist at Yamaichi
International (America) Inc.
</p>
<p>
   Today is expected to be another relatively quiet session. The
Federal Reserve is slated to release its so-called Beige Book report
on economic activity and the Treasury will announce the size of next
week's two-year and five-year note auctions. Analysts expect the
two-year note offering to total $15.5 billion and the five-year to
total $11.25 billion, both unchanged from the December auctions.
</p>
<p>
   Due to the federal holiday yesterday, the weekly jobless claims
figures and the Federal Reserve's money supply and banking data will
be delayed one day until tomorrow.

   Corporate & Junk Bonds
@
</p>
<p>
   Citicorp sold bonds to overwhelming investor demand yesterday
while junk bonds gained 1/4 to 1/2 point in strong buying.
</p>
<p>
   Investment-grade issues, meanwhile, finished flat to down 1/8
point in moderate activity.
</p>
<p>
   Despite more than $27 billion of new corporate issuance so far
this year, the gaps between the yields for corporate bonds and
Treasurys have held steady, traders say, suggesting that investors'
appetite for corporate bonds continues to match supply.
</p>
<p>
   The primary market turned in another strong session, with new
issuance totaling $1.1 billion. Yesterday's borrowers included
Citicorp, H.J. Heinz Co., Champion International Corp. and Alabama
Power Co., a unit of Southern Co.
</p>
<p>
   Despite a nearly 0.17 percentage point drop in long-term interest
rates since Jan. 9, issuance remains confined to notes maturing in
seven to 10 years. However, some syndicate officials said that could
change if the Treasury 30-year bond falls below 7.25%. The 30-year
bond yielded 7.33% as of late yesterday.
</p>
<p>
   Among specific junk issues, bonds of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.
climbed in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Traders said that
the company is expected to purchase an unspecified amount of its
subordinated debt in the secondary market.
</p>
<p>
   Bonds of Unisys Corp. also rose. The computer systems
manufacturer reported strong fourth-quarter earnings early
yesterday. Standard & Poor's Corp. later placed the company's senior
and subordinated debt ratings on CreditWatch with positive
implications.
</p>
<p>
   In other news, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said the credit
quality of U.S. corporations moderately improved in 1992 after a
steep three-year slide. While the country's corporate health is
expected to remain less than robust in 1993, Moody's added, "the gap
between corporate downgrades and upgrades will continue to narrow."
</p>
<p>
   Citicorp priced a $400 million issue of 10-year subordinated
notes at par to yield 8%. The noncallable issue was priced at a
spread of 1.43 percentage points above the Treasury 10-year note.
</p>
<p>
   Rated Baa-3 by Moody's and triple-B-plus by S&P, the issue will
be sold through underwriters led by Citicorp Securities Markets Inc.
</p>
<p>
   One dealer involved in the pricing said the offering was
originally expected to total $250 million, but was increased after
investors registered "overwhelming demand."
</p>
<p>
   On Tuesday, Citicorp reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter
earnings of $280 million, or 53 cents a share, compared with a loss
of $133 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. S&P
subsequently revised its ratings outlook on Citicorp and its units
to stable from negative.

   Municipal Bonds
@
</p>
<p>
   Prices of municipal bonds ended higher, although much of the
action in the tax-exempt market yesterday was in the primary market.
</p>
<p>
   In secondary trading, the North Carolina Municipal Power Agency's
6.20% revenue bonds of 2018 rose 1/4 to 99 1/4, to yield 6.24%.
</p>
<p>
   Among new issues, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's
$100 million of 84th Series revenue bonds, which were competitively
priced, were all sold by the end of the session.
</p>
<p>
   A Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. group is believed to have won the
bonds with a bid setting the net interest cost to the issuer at
about 6.275%.
</p>
<p>
   Interest on the bonds is subject to the federal alternative
minimum tax. Yields range from 5.80% in 2008 to 6.283% in 2028.
</p>
<p>
   The Port Authority expects to use proceeds of the sale for
certain capital expenditures at airport and marine terminal
facilities and for the refunding of certain obligations.
</p>
<p>
   Meanwhile, Guam Airport Authority's $247.9 million of Series A
and B general revenue bonds came out relatively strongly. At
repricing, yields ranged from 3.90% in 1994 to 6.748% in 2023.
Initially, the yields had ranged from 3.90% in 1994 to 6.82% in
2023.
</p>
<p>
   This is the first time the authority has come into the muni
marketplace and sold bonds solely on its credit rating. A Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. group served as lead manager of the
offering.

   Mortgage & Asset-Backed Securities
@
</p>
<p>
   Prices of mortgage securities ended slightly lower.
</p>
<p>
   Among secondary issues, Government National Mortgage Association
7.5% issues for February delivery ended 1/8 lower at 100 16/32,
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Gold 7.5% issues ended 5/32 lower
at 100 19/32 and Federal National Mortgage Association 7.5% issues
ended 5/32 lower at 100 12/32.
</p>
<p>
   About $1.5 billion of new real estate mortgage investment conduit
securities were announced yesterday, bringing the week's Remic
volume so far to $2.5 billion. That issuance is in addition to the
$3.5 billion of strips and modifiable and combinable securities also
priced this week.
</p>
<p>
   As expected, some 15-year collateral and 8% 30-year collateral
continue to be popular. In yesterday's issuance, the $400 million
Freddie Mac Gold 1472 deal was backed by Freddie Mac Gold 15-year 7%
securities, the $350 million Fannie Mae 1993-G5 deal was backed by
Ginnie Mae 30-year 8% issues and the $750 million Fannie Mae 1993-17
deal was backed by Fannie Mae 30-year 8% issues.
</p>
<p>
   Additionally, all of the heavy strips issuance this week used 8%
mortgage securities as collateral -- $1 billion from Freddie Mac and
$2.52 billion from Fannie Mae. 0240.00
