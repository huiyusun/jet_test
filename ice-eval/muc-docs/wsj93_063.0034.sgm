<p>
   The chief executive of a major consumer-products company is
emerging as a leading candidate to succeed James Robinson III as
chairman and chief executive of American Express Co.
</p>
<p>
   Growing support for the executive, whose identity wasn't
disclosed, on the committee conducting the search could force a
showdown between directors allied behind Harvey Golub, president of
the financial-services company, and those seeking a more seasoned
chief executive. The board is scheduled to meet next Sunday evening
and the following day.
</p>
<p>
   The executive, according to a person close to the search
committee, is one of "two excellent guys, both associated with
fixing things," at their companies who have been under review since
before Christmas. He declined to identify them. Neither is from a
financial services company, indicating that consumer marketing and
image building are considered the most important tasks at hand.
</p>
<p>
   While one of the executives is considered ahead of the other in
the running, the person close to the committee said both are chief
executives of major consumer-product companies and have proven
themselves in leading their companies to overcome significant
problems. One is in his early 50s, the other in his mid-50s, and
both are known for their hands-on management styles, he said.
</p>
<p>
   The next board meeting is likely to be Act II of the drama that
suddenly unfolded at a dinner meeting the night before the board met
in September and unceremoniously called for a search to begin that
could bring about the quick removal of Mr. Robinson, 57 years old.
</p>
<p>
   The person close to the search committee said the five-member
group is "close to a consensus" on one of the candidates, but that
it could "fall apart over terms and the due-diligence check."
Richard Furlaud, co-chairman of the committee and former chairman of
Bristol-Myers Inc., declined to comment when reached at his Florida
home.
</p>
<p>
   Board members who are eager to name an outsider as chief
executive, according to persons close to the board, include: David
Culver, retired chairman of Alcan Aluminium Ltd.; Rawleigh Warner
Jr., retired chairman of Mobil Corp.; John Byrne, chairman of Fund
American Companies Inc.; and William Bowen, president of the Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation. Also believed on their side is Howard Clark
Sr., a former American Express chairman and an adviser who attends
board meetings. Mr. Byrne declined comment when asked about the
report, and the others did not return phone calls or couldn't be
reached.
</p>
<p>
   But "the dissidents alone don't have the votes," on the 19-member
board to bring in an outsider, says one board member who asked not
to be identified. He added that the swing factor could be "if Jim
Robinson agrees to go to the outside" for his successor. Mr.
Robinson, who is co-chairman of the search committee, had been
grooming Mr. Golub to be his replacement. Many of the board members
remain loyal to Mr. Robinson, despite agreeing to the call for a new
chief executive soon. Efforts to reach Mr. Robinson were
unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>
   The board member added that if Mr. Robinson accedes to the call
for an outsider, "something has to be done to keep Harvey."
</p>
<p>
   Indeed, Mr. Golub, 53, has won high marks for re-engineering the
company's core Travel Related Services business, home of the Optima
credit card and American Express's charge cards. Since taking over
as chairman of the unit in the fall of 1991, he has launched a $1
billion cost-cutting plan, taken a more flexible approach to
merchant charges and support and boosted card spending through
innovative promotions.
</p>
<p>
   The level of support for him on the board is not clear. On
Thursday, Drew Lewis, a director and chief executive of Union
Pacific Corp., said, "If we had a vote, Harvey would win." But he
added he was not sure if there were yet enough votes for a
consensus, indicating that would be necessary for a final decision.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Lewis added that he does not feel American Express is in
"crisis" and that he would be satisfied if it took six months or
even a year to name a new chief executive, while Mr. Robinson and
Mr. Golub continue to head the company. Mr. Lewis declined to
discuss anything about the qualifications of any other candidates
for the job.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Lewis said Saturday that the situation had changed "since the
time I talked" and that he no longer felt as confident about Mr.
Golub's chances. He declined to say why, other than referring to
"new information" and an "alternative" candidate. Mr. Lewis would
only confirm that there are two serious outside candidates, but he
added that most of the board probably did not yet know the names of
the outside candidates. He declined to comment further on their
chances, saying, "These are matters for the board, not the press, to
discuss."
</p>
<p>
   An alternative to Mr. Golub is being sought, the person close to
the committee, said, because "Harvey is like the sophomore at West
Point who is getting all A's. But such a great company as American
Express needs a general who has already fought a few wars." He added
that an offer that might be made to keep him at the company is "an
understanding that if he performs well for three to five years" the
top post might then become available. But the ongoing role of Mr.
Golub has not yet been discussed at length with the candidates, he
added.
</p>
<p>
   American Express had been buffeted by large losses in the card
division and at a number of the financial businesses Mr. Robinson
had diversified the charge-card giant into during his 15-year reign.
The flagship American Express card, the center of the Travel Related
Services unit, also has been under siege from fierce credit card
competition at the customer and merchant levels.
</p>
<p>
   Large stockholders of American Express are eager for the chief
executive uncertainty to be resolved, says Alison Deans, an analyst
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "I hear from a lot of larger
holders of the stock that they want the company to do something, not
leave the situation in limbo." She adds that although she believes
the card division and the rest of the company are about to report a
fairly good quarter, "there are a lot of pressing issues. When there
is not clear decisive action, time is against them."
</p>
<p>
   The head of one of the five largest institutional holders of
American Express stock, however, not only wants the issue resolved
but says he wants to see Mr. Golub chosen. Although he has not
communicated with the board, he says, "I'd be surprised if they go
outside. I have a lot of confidence in him."
</p>
<p>
   If the board cannot reach agreement, however, one possibility,
say observers, is for it to name a director as chairman, with the
chief executive title going to Mr. Golub. Such a split recently took
effect at General Motors Corp. The likely board candidate is
believed to be Mr. Byrne, a strong advocate of getting value for
shareholders who also is close to Warren Buffett, a major American
Express investor.
