   What's in a name? Sometimes too much, sometimes not enough.
</p>
<p>
   Last year, the number of publicly traded companies that changed
their corporate monikers jumped to 107 from 83 the previous year,
according to a study scheduled for release today by Schechter Group,
a New York corporate and brand-identity consulting firm.
</p>
<p>
   A corporate name is as important as a brand name to Madison
Avenue, particularly when the company logo appears in commercials
and print ads. And industry executives say consumers are looking for
companies they can identify with; thus, fancy or stuffy names are
decidedly out. So, it appears, are names that associate a company
too closely with a controversial product such as tobacco, or names
that give no clue about a company's business.
</p>
<p>
   "Names are vitally important to advertising because entire
campaigns are sometimes based on corporate names," says Joseph
Smith, chairman of the New York consulting firm Oxtoby-Smith.
</p>
<p>
   The worst name change for last year, says Alvin Schechter,
chairman of the consulting firm that bears his name, resulted from
the merger between Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and Chemical Banking
Corp. The merged entities kept the Chemical name. "Both names were
terrible," he says. "Chemical is an unfriendly term and
Manufacturers's name was long and awkward."
</p>
<p>
   The companies fumbled a chance to promote the partnership with a
totally new name in the merger, says Mr. Schechter.
</p>
<p>
   A spokesman for Chemical says the two companies tried several
combinations of the names, but couldn't come up with anything they
liked better. An entirely new name was never considered because,
through advertising, each name had strong identity among consumers.
Finally, Chemical was retained because it had more branches.
</p>
<p>
   Other name changes "reflect the restructuring and focus on core
businesses that many publicly traded companies went through during
the recession," says Mr. Schechter.
</p>
<p>
   Still other companies changed names that no longer sounded
politically correct. PepsiCo's Kentucky Fried Chicken unit, one of
Mr. Schechter's clients, worried that urging people to eat anything
fried wasn't the best message to convey in the health-conscious
1990s.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Schechter hatched an idea: Drop the name entirely, use the
initials KFC and enlarge the image of Col. Sanders, the fast food
chain's icon, in advertising and on packaging. And the jingle,
"Kentucky Fried Chicken, we do chicken right," was re-recorded to,
"We are KFC, we do chicken right."
</p>
<p>
   In September, Horizon Gold Corp. changed its name to Horizon
Resources Corp. The word "gold" had lost its luster among investors
because of falling prices. A spokesman for the Golden, Colo.,
company says Horizon made the shift because it now mines potash
also.
</p>
<p>
   Some companies finally decide that less is more. American
Southwest Mortgage Investments Corp., in Tucson, Ariz., simplified
its name in June to ASR Investments Corp., saying the original was
just too much of a mouthful. Mr. Schecter notes that the use of
initials is also a way to "disguise" a company's nature and
guarantee anonymity.
</p>
<p>
   For example, Gulf Resources/Chemical last year deep-sixed that
name in favor of the less revealing Gulf USA Corp. The word
"chemical," says Mr. Schechter, doesn't convey an environmentally
sound message.
</p>
<p>
   In years past, companies changed their names to adapt to social
trends, says Mr. Schechter. Universal Leaf Tobacco in Richmond, Va.,
snuffed out its old name in 1990 in favor of Universal Corp. The
switch was made because the company had acquired non-tobacco
businesses, says a spokesman. The company shed some of those
unrelated businesses recently, but says it won't adopt its old
signature. "We're still not exclusively a tobacco company," says the
spokesman.
</p>
<p>
   Often, companies change their names to reflect dramatic changes
in their business or to focus attention on a star asset. In 1989,
for example, Gulf & Western Inc. changed its name to Paramount
Communications Inc.; the original name came from the company's
origins as a conglomerate in a hodge-podge of industrial operations.
After it shed most of those busineses to focus on entertainment and
publishing, the company decided to adopt the name of its largest
business, Paramount Pictures.
</p>
<p>
   The Schechter Group also tracked which companies are most likely
to change their names. Between 1987 and 1991, for example, 74
financial institutions switched monikers, and 64% of those dropped
the words "savings" and "loan," partly reflecting the S&L scandals
of the late 1980s and partly mirroring the blizzard of mergers and
acquisitions.
</p>
<p>
   But last year, one institution actually reversed the trend: Excel
Bancorp became Quincy Savings Bank. The change, says a spokesman of
the bank, based in Quincy, Mass., reflected a reorganization of its
holding company. Quincy Savings Bank had been used since 1845, and
the company wanted to go with a name long familiar to depositors.

   McCaffrey Loses Account
@
</p>
<p>
   Tiffany & Co., New York, moved its prestigious retail advertising
account from McCaffrey & McCall, New York, and consolidated an
estimated $20 million in world-wide advertising with
McCann-Erickson, New York.
</p>
<p>
   McCaffrey, which had handled Tiffany's estimated $10 million U.S.
account since 1986, holds onto the small corporate, or
business-to-business, portion of the account; exact billings
couldn't be determined. The loss is a tough blow to the agency,
badly shaken by the loss of the Mercedes-Benz account last year.
</p>
<p>
   Diana Lyne, Tiffany's senior vice president of marketing, said
Tiffany decided to move the retail account from McCaffrey because
"we think we need a truly international advertising agency to deal
with our growing international presence." McCaffrey has offices in
New York, Indianapolis and Toronto; it doesn't have any in Europe or
Asia.
</p>
<p>
   McCann-Erickson's Japan operations, McCann-Erickson Hakuhodo,
previously handled Tiffany advertising in Asia and the Far East.
Tiffany said it plans to keep the media portion of its account
in-house.

   Fallon Wins Hefty
@
</p>
<p>
   Mobil Corp. tapped Minneapolis agency Fallon McElligott,
Minneapolis, for its Hefty trash bag account, industry executives
said.
</p>
<p>
   The account was previously handled by Wells Rich Greene BDDP, New
York, the agency responsible for the "Hefty Hefty Hefty, Wimpy Wimpy
Wimpy" slogan.
</p>
<p>
   Fallon, a unit of WPP Group, beat out three other contenders,
including the Chicago office of Omnicom Group's DDB Needham; Jordan
McGrath Case & Taylor, New York; and Weightman Advertising,
Philadelphia. Mobil spent $9 million on Hefty advertising last year,
according to Leading National Advertisers, which tracks advertising.
A Mobil spokesman declined to comment.
