<p>
   President-elect Clinton is close to filling some sensitive
subcabinet jobs in foreign policy and economics, and has scheduled a
meeting with top aides this week to begin making decisions on
economic policy.
</p>
<p>
   Though he fulfilled his promise to finish naming his cabinet by
Christmas, Mr. Clinton has named only a few of his selections for
the second tier of advisers, many of which wield substantial power
in running the day-to-day operations of government agencies.
</p>
<p>
   For instance, Mr. Clinton is expected to name Peter Tarnoff,
president of the Council on Foreign Relations, to the influential
post of undersecretary of state for political affairs. That job is
the third-ranking post in the State Department, beneath the
secretary of state and his deputy, and traditionally is filled by a
career foreign-service officer who has broad responsibilities for
overseeing the daily work of the U.S. diplomatic corps.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Tarnoff was a career foreign service officer from 1961 until
1982. Like Secretary of State-designate Warren Christopher, Mr.
Tarnoff worked as a top State Department aide in the Carter
administration.
</p>
<p>
   Another potential choice for a top position in the State
Department is Democratic lawyer and consultant Tom Donilon, who also
could get a senior job in the White House. Mr. Donilon is close to
Mr. Christopher and practices in Mr. Christopher's law firm.
</p>
<p>
   In the trade area, the Clinton transition team has put together a
list of about 20 candidates to fill three slots for deputy U.S.
trade representatives plus the general counsel for the trade
representative's office. Among those under consideration, said
people familiar with the deliberations, are Michael Wessel, a trade
adviser to House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.); Barry
Carter, who heads the transition team's trade efforts; and Rufus
Yerxa, the current deputy trade representative to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
</p>
<p>
   Trade remains one of the most contentious issues for the new
administration, with Democrats split between free traders and those
who favor more managed trade. Indeed, it isn't clear who will make
trade policy, given that the nominee for the top slot, Mickey
Kantor, has no experience in international trade issues. Some of the
people being considered for positions in his office are also being
considered for trade positions in the National Economic Council,
which will be headed by Robert Rubin.
</p>
<p>
   Yesterday, Clinton transition officials were calling trade
experts to try to find the names of more blacks and Hispanics to
consider for trade positions.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Clinton is also believed to be sorting out his White House
staff this week. A host of aides, including Communications Director
George Stephanopoulos and transition official Mark Gearan, as well
as Democratic consultants Paul Begala and Mr. Donilon, could play
important roles in the White House. Their duties haven't been
decided, though Mr. Stephanopoulos is expected to remain in
communications.
</p>
<p>
   For the job of assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, New
York attorney Bernard Aidinoff is being given careful consideration
by the Clinton camp, according to Democratic sources. Mr. Aidinoff,
who is with the firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, was chairman of the
American Bar Association's tax section in the early 1980s and has
been a member of an advisory panel to the commissioner of the
Internal Revenue Service.
</p>
<p>
   People familiar with Mr. Aidinoff say he may be an appealing
choice for the new administration because he will be 64 and probably
wouldn't return to practicing law after government service. That
means he wouldn't have any problem adhering to the five-year
lobbying ban that Mr. Clinton has imposed on his top aides.
</p>
<p>
   Among the other possible candidates for the Treasury tax post is
Hank Gutman, the chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee
on Taxation and a former Treasury official.
</p>
<p>
   For the Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Clinton is expected to
name Alan Blinder, an economist at Princeton University, to serve on
the three-member panel. Mr. Blinder went to graduate school at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology with Laura Tyson, the
University of California economist who is to be chairman of the
council.
</p>
<p>
   As the Clinton transition continues to fill positions, finding
jobs for former campaign officials has become a challenge. Some
campaign workers have been told they will probably get six-month
appointments at various agencies, which would give them time to
become familiar with the government and find a permanent post.
</p>
<p>
   One campaign official slated for a job is New York attorney Kevin
Thurm, who is expected to be named chief of staff to Health and
Human Services Secretary-designate Donna Shalala. Mr. Thurm was New
York state director for the Clinton campaign and an Oxford classmate
of Mr. Stephanopoulos, suggesting that the White House will have
direct influence in the operation of HHS.
</p>
<p>
   Also at HHS, defeated New York Rep. Thomas Downey is under
consideration for a new position as deputy for human services. And
Stuart Altman, a Clinton campaign adviser and transition official,
is being considered for a post that would direct health services at
the department.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Clinton also will be turning this week to the task of setting
his economic policies more firmly. Mr. Stephanopoulos said Mr.
Clinton's economic appointees will gather in Little Rock with the
president-elect on Thursday. At the meeting, Mr. Clinton and his
advisers will discuss the hard choices on spending that must be made
to implement his programs while also cutting the budget deficit.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Stephanopoulos said the Clinton team will be reviewing
estimates of the federal deficit. The Clinton team wants to get "a
final fix on it. I mean, it's a moving number all of the time," Mr.
Stephanopoulos said. He added that Mr. Clinton will be talking with
his advisers by telephone as he prepares for the Thursday meeting.
