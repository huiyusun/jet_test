   International Business Machines Corp. ranks as the world's most
highly regarded company in developing international executives,
concludes a new Harvard University survey of 929 senior executives
in 30 countries.
</p>
<p>
   IBM officials attribute the ranking to the personal involvement
of Chairman Louis V. Gerstner in top managers' career development as
well as the company's heavy reliance on foreign nationals for
overseas posts. Surveyed executives said both efforts will become
more common among companies committed to grooming global managers.
</p>
<p>
   The Harvard study, apparently unique in its broad scope, was
sponsored by Amrop International, an international partnership of
executive recruiters, and is set for release next week. Those polled
work for more than 500 different companies around the world.
</p>
<p>
   In the survey, four other big multinational concerns ranked just
after IBM in developing their international executives: Royal
Dutch/Shell Group; Unilever PLC; Procter & Gamble Co. and ABB Asea
Brown Boveri AG.
</p>
<p>
   Though 94% of surveyed executives said developing international
executives was vitally important to their businesses, only 46%
termed their companies successful in filling international executive
jobs. "These executives are saying that if they don't find better
ways to develop global executives, they will be handicapped" and
perhaps beaten by their competition, said C. Douglas Caldwell, vice
chairman of Amrop International and chairman of Caldwell Partners, a
search firm in Toronto.
</p>
<p>
   "Those companies whose CEOs are actively involved in executive
career development report greater success internationally than those
whose CEOs are not," the Harvard report said. IBM, for example, gets
more than 50% of its business from outside the U.S. Mr. Gerstner,
the new chief executive, imitates his predecessor John Akers by
annually reviewing detailed career development plans for the
computer concern's 1,500 senior managers, Gerald Czarnecki, senior
vice president of human resources and administration, said in an
interview.
</p>
<p>
   The review includes checking whether "executives are given
opportunities to gain international experience," Mr. Czarnecki
added. About 15% to 20% of these top executives have worked abroad
and that proportion "will keep going up," he said.
</p>
<p>
   To improve a company's batting average in this area, 69% of the
survey respondents said their chief executive officer will formulate
strategies for international career development within five years --
up from the 38% today. Polled executives predicted similarly large
gains in the CEO's expected involvement in hiring, assigning and
assuring promotions of successful international executives.
</p>
<p>
   "I always have and will continue to drive the issue of
multinational experience for executives," said Stephen Kaufman,
president and CEO of Arrow Electronics Inc., a big distributor of
electronic components in Melville, N.Y. "I consider that a prime
role" of a CEO, he added. Arrow has 5,000 employees world-wide,
including 1,600 in Europe.
</p>
<p>
   The Harvard study also detected a shift away from big companies'
traditional practice of sending executives overseas from their
headquarters. More than half of those surveyed now transfer people
abroad from the company's home country -- but just 34% expect to do
so in the future. Instead, 74% said they will recruit more foreign
nationals, up from 45% today.
</p>
<p>
   IBM also is altering its strategies for developing international
managerial talent, Mr. Czarnecki disclosed. Only a handful of the 25
or 30 IBM executives with global reponsibilities now come from
countries other than the U.S., he noted. "We want to increase the
involvement of more senior management from outside the U.S.," he
continued. He said IBM intends to do this by bringing more foreign
executives here for assignments at headquarters or at operating
divisions.
