   Searching for the next big bank merger?
</p>
<p>
   Forget assets.
</p>
<p>
   Forget return on equity.
</p>
<p>
   Forget earnings.
</p>
<p>
   Just look for an aging chief executive officer.
</p>
<p>
   More so than in any other industry bank executives have wide
latitude to choose with whom they will or won't link up. Regulatory
issues virtually preclude hostile takeovers, and big egos are a bar
to mergers between banks headed by young and aggressive chief
executives.
</p>
<p>
   The result has been an increasing number of mergers between banks
in which at least one partner is headed by a chief executive
destined to retire soon. And there probably are going to be more.
</p>
<p>
   "A company with a strong chairman approaching retirement age,
without clearly visible succession, potentially can be a candidate
for a merger or sale," says John Leonard, banking analyst at Salomon
Brothers who examined recent mergers and concluded there is a clear
link between mergers and aging executives.
</p>
<p>
   Other bank experts agree. "When people ask us the next deals, one
of the things we look at is the CEO's age," said James Marx, editor
of Bank Mergers & Acquisitions newsletter. "A lot of deals,
especially thrifts, are being done because managers wish to cash out
before retiring."
</p>
<p>
   In KeyCorp's recent merger agreement with Society Corp., KeyCorp
Chairman Victor Riley, who is 62 years old, had no successor, and
Society Chairman Robert Gillespie is just 49. Although KeyCorp
officials concede that the succession issue was one reason the
merger was sought, they deny it was the driving force behind the
linkup with Society.
</p>
<p>
   And there were other potential suitors. John McCoy, the
acquisitive chairman of Banc One Corp. in Columbus, Ohio, wrote Mr.
Riley expressing interest in a deal during the Key-Society
discussions, but KeyCorp shrugged off Banc One's offer to talk. That
likely would have meant an acquisition by the larger Banc One.
</p>
<p>
   "Just because Victor Riley was nearing retirement doesn't mean
KeyCorp was," says Lee Irving, Key's treasurer.
</p>
<p>
   Pending retirements apparently have contributed to other deals.
Analysts point to Boatmen's Bancshares Inc.'s purchase of SunWest
Financial Corp., First Bank System Inc.'s acquisition of Colorado
National Bancshares and a couple of recent acquisitions by First
Fidelity Bancorp. as examples of deals struck in part because of the
age of the target's chief executive.
</p>
<p>
   Those banks either wouldn't comment or didn't return calls, but
other bankers concede that age is a factor in deals. "In theory, it
should not be a factor," says Richard Kovasevich, chief executive of
Norwest Corp., Minneapolis. "But in practice, it absolutely does
play a role."
</p>
<p>
   And Banc One's Mr. McCoy acknowledges that young bank executives
are loath to give up their positions in a merger. "Once you have the
golden ring, it's hard to let go," he says, adding that "there's so
much energy wasted on the politics of who's going to be the chief
executive or chief financial officer, who gets what job and is it
fair."
</p>
<p>
   Analysts and investors say First Chicago Corp. and First
Interstate Bancorp could be considered retirement plays in the near
term. And they suggest that in a few years, Bank of New York Co.
could become a retirement play.
</p>
<p>
   Harrumph, say the banks.
</p>
<p>
   "He's not that old," protests a spokeswoman for Richard Thomas,
First Chicago's 62-year-old chairman. And yesterday's announcement
that Mr. Thomas picked a president -- and heir apparent -- reduces
the chances of a succession play.
</p>
<p>
   A spokesman for Edward Carson, the 63-year-old chairman of First
Interstate, pointedly notes that there's a long history of in-house
succession. Ditto for Bank of New York, says a spokesman for
60-year-old Chairman J. Carter Bacot.
</p>
<p>
   Lest you take all this too seriously, note that picking the next
bank merger on any basis isn't necessarily a rewarding pastime.
Although many banks' shares also have slipped in price, since
KeyCorp's merger with Society was announced, KeyCorp's shares have
fallen 12.6% to $34.50.
