   Executives yearning for the top jobs at their companies
increasingly face unforeseen competitors: outside directors.
</p>
<p>
   Board seats have become steppingstones to top jobs in recent
months. The trend reflects a growing number of boardroom coups,
greater demand for independent directors with good business skills
and boards' increased willingness to look outside current management
for new talent.
</p>
<p>
   Six of the 51 new chief executives chosen by major industrial
companies during the first half of 1993 previously had been outside
directors at those businesses, says Eugene Jennings, a board
consultant and Michigan State University emeritus professor of
management. That figure nearly equals the seven such appointments in
all of 1992 -- and portends a record high for the year, he notes.
"We seem to be using boards more as a training ground for our future
chiefs."
</p>
<p>
   Fresh examples keep popping up. Last week, FHP International
Corp., a managed-care and insurance concern, named an outside
director co-chief executive and president. In August,
aerospace-materials maker Hexcel Corp. tapped two outside board
members to be co-chief executives. And in July, Giddings & Lewis
Inc., a big machine-tool manufacturer, replaced its chairman and CEO
with a board outsider.
</p>
<p>
   At the same time, some headhunters say corporate clients have
begun to demand outside directors with the potential to succeed the
companies' chief executives. New York recruiter E. Pendleton James
received his first such assignment two years ago -- and has since
filled similar board slots for two other companies.
</p>
<p>
   However, most boards crowning a fellow member act out of crisis.
At Hexcel, a defense contractor hurt by military spending cutbacks,
directors ousted Robert L. Witt, the company chairman and chief
executive, last summer after objecting to the way he was
restructuring the company.
</p>
<p>
   Donald J. O'Mara, the concern's president and chief operating
officer, lacked enough experience to replace Mr. Witt, board members
say. But Hexcel "could ill afford to spend two or three months
trying to find the right person" from outside because it already was
"in default on its loan agreement," recalls John J. Lee, an investor
and outside director. "You can't put an unstable business into
suspended animation while you go find someone to come and run it,"
he emphasizes.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Lee says he and another outside director, John L. Doyle,
proposed that they jointly run Hexcel after the board split over
which of the two should be the new CEO. Mr. Lee also became
chairman. Last month, Hexcel expanded its restructuring efforts by
announcing a third-quarter charge of $50 million, new layoffs and
plans to cut capacity.
</p>
<p>
   Outside directors who become chief executives say their board
experience greatly shortened their learning curve once they took
charge. "I've probably made a number of changes more quickly than I
otherwise would have done," observes Randall Tobias, the new
chairman and CEO of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly & Co. A Lilly
outside director since 1986, he previously was a vice chairman of
American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Tobias met with Wall Street securities analysts on July 20,
just three weeks after he assumed command of Lilly, which has
recently suffered disappointing earnings and other setbacks. "I'm
not sure I would have had the confidence to do that if I hadn't come
to Lilly knowing the people and the situation," the 51-year-old
chief executive says. This month, Mr. Tobias unveiled plans to
broadly shake up the once-staid drug maker, starting with 4,000 job
cuts through early retirements and reassignments.
</p>
<p>
   At Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., outside director Stanley Gault was
named chairman and CEO in 1991 and led the rejuvenation of the
company. The impact of Mr. Gault, who had previously retired as
chairman of Rubbermaid Inc., "has been reflected on the bottom line
in a very short period of time -- and very dramatically," says G.G.
Michelson, a Goodyear outside director.
</p>
<p>
   But in some cases, an outside director's links with prior
management raise doubts about his or her independence as new CEO.
The issue arose last summer when Jeffrey C. Barbakow became chairman
and CEO of National Medical Enterprises Inc. after co-founders
Richard K. Eamer and Leonard Cohen resigned under pressure from the
beleaguered hospital chain. Mr. Barbakow, an outside board member
since 1990, is a longtime friend of Mr. Eamer's. As a managing
director of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Mr. Barbakow also was an
investment banker for National Medical.
</p>
<p>
   Todd Richter, an analyst at Dean Witter, Discover & Co.,
initially worried that Mr. Barbakow might be an Eamer puppet because
he "does have a tie to the management team that got the company in
trouble in the first place." The U.S. government has launched a
criminal investigation of National Medical, and insurers have sued
the company for allegedly filing fraudulent claims.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Barbakow overcame analysts' fears by distancing himself from
his predecessor. "I am not worried about that question mark" of the
Eamer friendship, he insists. "The record speaks for itself. We are
trying to make the right decisions."
</p>
<p>
   Transplants from the boardroom to the executive suite don't
always work out. This month, Lawrence Gordon abruptly stepped down
as chief operating officer of Domino's Pizza Inc., a post he had
held since January. He departed about a year after joining the
Domino's board. The 71-year-old turnaround specialist says Thomas S.
Monaghan, Domino's founder and CEO, fired him one Saturday afternoon
while he was home alone, watching a televised football game. Mr.
Monaghan "felt there were differences in our methodology and that he
would like to end the relationship," Mr. Gordon recollects with
dismay.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Monaghan disagrees with that account. Mr. Gordon's "work in
spearheading the financial restructuring of Domino's was largely
completed," a spokesman says. "Tom wished him well and felt he did a
good job."
