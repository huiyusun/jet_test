   High anxiety grips America's executive suites these days as a
record number of chief executive officers topple from power.
</p>
<p>
   Since 1991, two dozen CEOs of major U.S. corporations -- from
American Express Co. to Westinghouse Electric Corp. -- have been
forced out by activist boards. Leaders no longer can depend on
handpicked board allies for their job security. "I feel like I've
been stripped of my office by a bunch of turncoats," declared Carl
Karcher, founder of Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc., after a board
primarily made up of his longtime friends ousted him this month as
chairman of the fast-food chain in Anaheim, Calif.
</p>
<p>
   Now, more corporate chiefs are trying to fortify their chances of
survival by significantly revamping their dealings with directors.
Some are involving independent board members more in running the
day-to-day business. Other CEOs are asking boards for rigorous and
formal evaluations of their performance. A few company heads even
engage outside consultants to smooth their dealings with directors.
Or they try to forge closer ties with powerful board members.
</p>
<p>
   Even executives who appear secure in their jobs are going the
extra mile. Consider Irving W. Bailey II, chairman and CEO of
Capital Holding Corp., a big insurance and consumer-finance concern
in Louisville, Ky. Last winter, Mr. Bailey says he traveled to five
U.S. cities to brainstorm with directors about ways to improve
selection of new board members and other corporate-governance
issues. CEOs have rarely conducted such hand holding outside a
crisis situation, management experts say.
</p>
<p>
   John Nash, president of the National Association of Corporate
Directors in Washington, agrees. "In the past, CEOs treated boards
like mushrooms," he says. "They kept them in the dark and fed them
manure."
</p>
<p>
   Poor board chemistry played a greater role than poor financial
results in the recent departure of several prominent CEOs. Last
April, for instance, directors of Giddings & Lewis Inc. demanded the
resignation of William J. Fife, its chairman and chief executive,
even though he had transformed the formerly cash-starved concern
into a successful maker of factory machines. Board members said Mr.
Fife had begun to treat Giddings as if it were his own. Executives
cited his abrasive management approach. At the time of his
departure, Mr. Fife cited Giddings's strong earnings growth. He
declines to comment further.
</p>
<p>
   Bernard Marcus, chairman and chief executive of Home Depot Inc.,
a major home-improvement chain, believes more CEOs may get pushed
out if they fail to involve board members in day-to-day business.
Directors of the Atlanta company must make unannounced visits to
between eight and 10 Home Depot stores every quarter. After walking
around a store and chatting anonymously with customers, a director
divulges his or her identity in order to hear workers' gripes.
</p>
<p>
   The requirement, extended to outside directors in 1991, enables
the chain to learn quickly about dirty floors, difficult customers,
inadequate employee training and other store problems. Equally
important, Mr. Marcus says, "you are now dealing with members of the
board who absolutely know and understand your business."
</p>
<p>
   Directors' first-hand knowledge also buttresses Mr. Marcus's job
security, some suggest. The store visits are part of Home Depot's
highly open corporate culture that "says there won't be any board
surprises or board overthrows" of the chief executive, says Faye
Wilson, a Home Depot director and BankAmerica Corp. executive vice
president.
</p>
<p>
   An extensive performance evaluation is another increasingly
popular device that some chief executives use to lengthen their
tenure. In 1989, only 14% of 644 companies systematically evaluated
their CEO's performance, concluded a survey by consultants Sibson &
Co. "That figure probably has at least doubled" since then, says
Craig Schneier, a management consultant in Princeton, N.J., who
conducted the Sibson study.
</p>
<p>
   Thomas Gossage, chairman and chief executive of Hercules Inc.,
negotiated his first written "accountability" list last spring with
the board of the Wilmington, Del., chemical and aerospace company.
He proposed five areas of accountability, including earnings
improvement, reduction in the number of worker injuries, increased
community awareness of Hercules's antipollution efforts and a shift
in the company's mix of businesses.
</p>
<p>
   Directors weren't satisfied. They asked Mr. Gossage to toughen
certain goals. Mr. Gossage says directors asked him to draw up a
strategic road map and goals for the year 2000; he had proposed to
reach a certain return on shareholder equity by 1995.
</p>
<p>
   In December, a board committee will evaluate Mr. Gossage against
his checklist. He thinks the process enhances his job security.
Directors "can't come out of left field and say, `You aren't doing
what we want you to do,' because we have a contract that we
negotiate every year," he says. "To that extent I am at less risk
than I would have been if I wasn't having that kind of dialogue with
the board."
</p>
<p>
   Other leaders hope to prolong their reigns by getting expert
advice on handling directors. "In this environment, you have to take
a more personal role" in dealing with a board, says the president
and CEO of a Midwestern producer of paper and plastics. Soon after
he became president last fall, a few directors encouraged him to see
an executive coach.
</p>
<p>
   Dee Soder in New York counseled him for four months. He says he
learned, among other things, the importance of building coalitions
with key directors as well as understanding individual members'
private agendas. In May, the board promoted him to CEO.
</p>
<p>
   A growing number of chief executives use another type of hired
gun: the National Association of Corporate Directors. The NACD
charges $25,000 to play troubleshooter when a CEO's relations with
directors sour. Businesses currently summon the group a dozen times
a year -- up from twice a year about three years ago, officials
report.
</p>
<p>
   Last fall, the association helped save the head of a successful
billion-dollar maker of business supplies. Board members were "very,
very unhappy" because the chief executive told them so little,
recalls the NACD's Mr. Nash. Several directors threatened to resign
during a two-day board retreat organized by Mr. Nash at the
corporation's headquarters in Seattle. He says he finally persuaded
the CEO to reform or ultimately face dismissal. Today, the top
executive holds regular strategic-planning sessions with directors
-- and even returns their calls.
</p>
<p>
   Such survival attempts don't always succeed. Last January,
Eastman Kodak Co. announced that Kaye Whitmore, then chairman and
chief executive, had formed a special board panel to work with
senior management and improve communication with outside directors.
But people close to Kodak now say it was the board that created the
committee to oversee Mr. Whitmore and prod him to make massive cost
cuts. In any case, the idea didn't work. Directors disliked his
turnaround plan. Mr. Whitmore wouldn't comment. In August, the board
ousted him.
