   Eastco Industrial Safety Corp., Huntington Station, N.Y., said it
expects to post a loss for fiscal 1993 and "disappointing" results
for fiscal first quarter of 1994.
</p>
<p>
   The maker and distributor of industrial safety products said its
president and chief executive officer stepped down.
</p>
<p>
   Joel Poznansky, 35 years old, who joined the company in July as
vice president of manufacturing, was named president and chief
executive officer, succeeding Alan E. Densen, 60, who became senior
vice president. Mr. Densen will continue as a director and chairman.
</p>
<p>
   Eastco said it's likely the company will report a loss for fiscal
1994, which ends in June. It attributed the poor performance to
"weak industry conditions and a shortage of working capital."
</p>
<p>
   In order to improve its working capital, Eastco extended its
credit arrangements with its principal lender by another year, and
the senior management collectively loaned $250,000 to the company,
an amount which was matched by the bank. The company, which employs
about 200 people, said it's implementing a series of cost-cutting
measures, including layoffs.
