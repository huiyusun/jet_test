   Compensation for 200 of the highest-paid chief financial officers
jumped an average 25% last year as corporations recognized their
broader talents and moved to keep the headhunters at bay.
</p>
<p>
   Their pay on average was $458,636, up from $366,332, according to
a new survey, to be published this week by Global Finance magazine.
The report is based on public filings from 1,500 of the nation's
largest corporations that list the five highest-paid executives in
each company. Salary, cash bonuses, profit-sharing and certain
perquisites are included in the $458,636 figure, but not options
exercised and restricted stock granted.
</p>
<p>
   As the role of chief financial officer has evolved in recent
years "from numbers-cruncher to strategic planner," says Carl
Burgen, editor in chief of the specialty publication, "companies are
considering CFOs a critical component of top management -- and are
paying them accordingly."
</p>
<p>
   To be sure, the average chief financial officer didn't enjoy such
a hefty increase. In fact, average salary and bonus held steady for
chief financial officers at 400 of the nation's largest industrial
corporations in 1992, according to Hewitt Associates, Lincolnshire,
Ill., a compensation consulting firm. The reason for the discrepancy
between the two surveys: By relying on proxies detailing companies'
five best-compensated executives, Global Finance is starting with
chief financial officers who are, by definition, outstanding
performers and tend to get big raises.
</p>
<p>
   Holding first place in the Global Finance survey is James
Cunnane, chief financial officer of defense contractor General
Dynamics Corp. In 1992, Mr. Cunnane, 55 years old, took home more
than $3 million in salary and bonuses. The bonuses were linked to a
320% increase in the stock's value between 1991 and 1992, a
spokesman says. The compensation represented a 535% boost over Mr.
Cunnane's 1991 pay.
</p>
<p>
   In second-place is Rollin Dick, chief financial officer of
Conseco Inc., a Carmel, Ind., insurance holding company. Mr. Dick,
60, got a 91% pay increase in 1992, earning just above $2 million. A
Conseco spokesman noted that 1992 operating earnings-per-share was
up 79%.
</p>
<p>
   The Global Finance survey, conducted by Investors' Fiduciary
Services in Atlanta, puts the median 1992 pay at $379,686, an
increase of 16.8%. The fact that the median -- the middle figure in
a list from highest to lowest -- is lower than the average suggests
that the average is skewed by big salaries at the top of the list.
Still, by eliminating the three highest and lowest salaries from the
calculations, the average pay drops only to $450,599, a 24.6% annual
boost.
</p>
<p>
   Several chief financial officers enjoying big pay raises have
gained added titles and responsibilities. James Dimon, Chief
Financial Officer of Primerica Corp. since 1986, saw his pay jump
20%, to $1.3 million, as the 37-year-old also became the
financial-services company's president. At Marion Merrell Dow Inc.,
chief financial officer Edward Mehrer, 54, also became chief
administrative officer. His pay climbed 36%, to $688,335.
</p>
<p>
   As demand has increased over the past several years for
experienced cost-cutting executives, many companies with
battle-tested finance chiefs have begun to reward them more
generously "to make sure the CFO doesn't leave," says James Woodrum,
an executive compensation consultant with Hewitt Associates.
</p>
<p>
   "For CFOs of a certain stature, there is something approaching a
bidding war for their services by companies who really need that
cost-cutting expertise," Mr. Woodrum says.
</p>
<p>
   Windle Priem, an executive recruiter with Korn/Ferry
International, adds, "With all the massive restructurings and
repositionings, this is the age of the CFO." Some chief financial
officers recruited recently are earning 40% more than predecessors,
he says.
</p>
<p>
   By relying on proxy filings, the Global Finance study may well
understate the pay of the nation's elite chief financial officers.
In many of the largest corporations, wellpaid divisional chiefs edge
out chief financial officers for spots on the proxy list of the five
highest-compensated individuals; still, those chief financial
officers actually are paid much more than some of their counterparts
at other corporations who do make the proxy list.
</p>
<p>
   The rise in pay of chief financial officers is even more
impressive when exercised stock options and restricted stock grants
are taken into consideration, the survey indicates. Average
compensation soars to $945,532, up 40% from 1991. A big reason for
the jump: Chief financial officers joined the executive rush to
exercise stock options before Congress could levy heavier personal
taxes.
