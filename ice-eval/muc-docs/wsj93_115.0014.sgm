<p>
   In his first major management move since taking the
helm of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Chairman Arthur
Levitt consolidated control of the SEC's 12 regional and branch
offices under five regional directors.
</p>
<p>
   All five regional directors will report to William McLucas, head
of the SEC's enforcement division in Washington. In the past, the
administrators of the SEC's regional offices have shared equal
ranking and reported directly to the chairman of the SEC.
</p>
<p>
   Those promoted from regional administrator to the new regional
directorships are Elaine Cacheris of the Los Angeles office, to head
the Pacific region; Robert Davenport of Denver, to head the Central
region; William Goldsberry of Chicago, to head the Midwest region,
and Richard Walker of New York, to head the Northeastern region.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Levitt, who has been SEC chairman less than six weeks, didn't
immediately name a director for the Southeast region, covering the
SEC's regional office in Atlanta and its branch in Miami. He did say
in a statement that the regional base will shift to Miami from
Atlanta.
</p>
<p>
   Separately, Mr. Levitt appointed Donald Hoerl to fill the vacant
administrator's post in the SEC's Philadelphia office, which will be
part of the Northeast region. Mr. Hoerl, an 11-year veteran of the
SEC, spent the past six years as head of the SEC's branch office in
Salt Lake City and was previously chief trial counsel in the SEC's
Denver office.
