   In the wake of a takeover by News Corp., the chief
executive officer of Star TV resigned after less than six months in
that post, industry executives said.
</p>
<p>
   Last week, News Corp. bought 63.6% of the satellite broadcaster,
which serves the entire Asian region, for $525 million in cash and
stock from Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and the family of Li Ka-shing.
</p>
<p>
   At the time of the purchase, News Corp. executives said they
would like the executive, Julian Mounter, to stay. However, Star's
chief balked at the prospect of not reporting directly to Rupert
Murdoch, News Corp.'s chairman and chief executive officer, people
close to Mr. Mounter said. Both Mr. Mounter and a Star spokesman
declined to comment.
</p>
<p>
   It is likely that Star's new chief executive will report to
either Sam Chisholm, chief executive of News Corp.'s U.K.-based
satellite broadcaster, British Sky Broadcasting, or Chase Carey,
chief operating officer of News Corp.'s Fox Inc. film and television
unit.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Mounter's departure is expected to be formally announced this
week.
</p>
<p>
   Although there are no obvious successors, it is expected that Mr.
Murdoch will choose someone from either British Sky Broadcasting or
Fox to run Star, said a person close to News Corp.
