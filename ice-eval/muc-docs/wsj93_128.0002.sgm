@  Who Has the Package of Pot Now

   President Clinton may have gotten off to a rocky
start in some ways, but you can't knock his courtesy.
</p>
<p>
   When Ron Kiczenski of Paso Robles, Calif., sent a package that he
says contained a quarter-pound of marijuana to Mr. Clinton, the
president was kind enough to reply with a thank-you note.
</p>
<p>
   "Thanks so much for writing," the form letter said. "I welcome
your thoughts and promise they will be carefully considered. I
appreciate your taking the time to let me know how you feel."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Kiczenski, 29 years old, says he sent the dope to the White
House, but not because he felt it was finally time for Mr. Clinton
to inhale. Though he admits to taking a toke or two to relax,
smoking marijuana, he says, is "about the last thing it's good for."
</p>
<p>
   He says he wants the drug legalized, not for recreational
purposes but for the economic value of hemp, the plant from which
marijuana is cultivated. Using hemp would help save other precious
natural resources, he argues. Hemp can be used to make a variety of
products, he adds, that now come from timber and petroleum
byproducts. To make his point, he sent the marijuana wrapped in
cloth made from hemp, and the accompanying letter was written on
paper made from hemp.
</p>
<p>
   The White House declined to respond to press inquiries about the
marijuana mail, but Mr. Kiczenksi says that in tape-recorded
telephone conversations he made with White House employees they
acknowledge receipt of the pot package.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Kiczenski, who wants to be arrested for mailing marijuana to
the president, hopes an arrest will generate the publicity he craves
for his cause. He has spoken with the Secret Service and Drug
Enforcement Administration agents, but so far they seem to have more
important things to do.
</p>
<p>
   He did get a nice letter from Mary Lee Warren, chief of the
Justice Department's narcotic and dangerous-drug section, thanking
him for his phone call "informing us of your shipment of marijuana
to President Clinton at the White House." Ms. Warren referred the
case to the DEA.
</p>
<p>
   He also got a letter from the chief of the forest service, who
responded to the advocacy of hemp byproducts by noting other
solutions to save trees. He also reminded Mr. Kiczenski that "the
cultivation of hemp is no longer legal."
