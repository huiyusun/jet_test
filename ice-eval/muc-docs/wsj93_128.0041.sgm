<p>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. is expected to announce today
a high-level management reorganization, according to individuals
close to the company.
</p>
<p>
   They said AT&T Chairman Robert E. Allen has revamped AT&T's upper
ranks in the biggest management restructuring since AT&T's hostile
takeover of NCR Corp. two years ago and the company's restructuring
into business units in 1988.
</p>
<p>
   In addition, Mr. Allen will name Richard Miller, former chairman
of Wang Laboratories Inc., to be AT&T's new executive vice president
and chief financial officer. AT&T declined to comment on the
management changes, which were approved yesterday by directors and
become effective Aug. 1.
</p>
<p>
   The changes reflect Mr. Allen's desire to accelerate AT&T's
globalization and move into multimedia products and communications
services, insiders said. Mr. Allen has said he wants at least 50% of
AT&T's revenue to come from overseas from the current 25% by the end
of the decade, and he has begun installing country and regional
managers to build mini-AT&Ts to do just that in key markets such as
China and Spain.
</p>
<p>
   Now Mr. Allen has elevated AT&T's most senior executives and
expanded the management roles of several others as he continues this
quest. Some of the spade work for this expansion had already been
done by former vice chairman Randall Tobias, who recently left AT&T
to become the chairman of Eli Lilly and Co.
</p>
<p>
   Victor Pelson, group executive of AT&T's huge Communication
Services Group, will become executive vice president of AT&T in
charge of a newly formed seven-member Global Operations Team, said
one person familiar with the changes. Mr. Pelson, 56, will also
function as AT&T's chief operating officer and will be named to
AT&T's board, succeeding Mr. Tobias, he said.
</p>
<p>
   Similarly, William Marx, 54, group executive of AT&T's Network
Systems Group, has been named executive vice president. He will
retain his current duties as chief executive of Network Systems and
will pick up responsibility for world-wide purchasing at AT&T and
AT&T's global manufacturing planning.
</p>
<p>
   "The idea is to have regions stand on their own, a much better
geographic balance instead of running things out of Basking Ridge,
N.J.," one individual said. "Both Pelson and Marx will be jointly
responsible for accelerating AT&T's global expansion and will set up
regional and country leadership structure for our operations
overseas."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Allen also revised the responsibilities of three of AT&T's
top executives, managers whom some insiders regard as having the
greatest potential for succeeding Mr. Allen when he reaches
mandatory retirement in seven years. Mr. Allen, 58, who took over as
AT&T's chairman five years ago, has never named a president and has
said he hasn't any immediate plans to do so.
</p>
<p>
   Alex Mandl, AT&T's chief financial officer, was named to succeed
Mr. Pelson as head of Communications Services. A former chairman of
Sea-Land Services Inc., Mr. Mandl, 49, has wielded tremendous
influence over AT&T's financial management since Mr. Allen lured him
to the company two years ago.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Mandl has helped streamline AT&T's finances, developing and
enforcing new compensation packages for making the company more
profitable and competitive. He has also become AT&T's chief
negotiator on key strategic transactions, including AT&T's planned
$3.8 billion investment in McCaw Cellular Communications Co., the
nation's largest cellular phone company.
</p>
<p>
   Now, as an executive vice president, Mr. Mandl will head AT&T's
core long-distance services business, which accounts for more than
$40 billion of AT&T's $65 billion in annual revenue, as well as
other businesses such as wireless services and credit cards. "Bob
wants to give Alex an operating role at AT&T," said one insider.
</p>
<p>
   In addition, Robert M. Kavner, currently group executive of
AT&T's Communications Products Group, was made an executive vice
president. AT&T also expanded the scope of his group, renaming it
the Multimedia Products and Services Group. Mr. Kavner, 50, has been
AT&T's point man in computers, pushing the company's hostile
takeover of NCR and move into pocket data communicators and other
multimedia products. "Allen is determined not to miss opportunities
as communications, computing and entertainment are merging," said
one individual familiar with Mr. Kavner's new assignment.
</p>
<p>
   Jerre Stead, currently president of AT&T's NCR unit, was named an
executive vice president of AT&T. Named to his new assignment at NCR
only a few months ago, Mr. Stead, 50, a former chairman of Square D
Corp., will be asked to take a more active role in helping AT&T's
overseas expansion. "Since half of his operations are overseas he'll
work most closely with Pelson and Marx on the globalization effort
as well," an insider said.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Miller, a former chief financial officer of RCA Corp. who
moved to General Electric Co. after its takeover of RCA in 1986,
joined Wang in 1990 when the computer company was struggling to
reverse huge losses and pay off a cumbersome debt. An AT&T insider
said the 52-year-old Mr. Miller was chosen not only for his
financial acumen but also his background in consumer electronics.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Marx's elevation and new responsibilities outside the Network
Systems Group, required that Mr. Allen appoint a new president and
chief operating officer of the group's giant unit that builds
switching and transmission equipment for phone companies and
businesses. Promoted to president and chief operating officer at the
unit, also called AT&T Network Systems, is Richard McGuinn, 46, who
is currently senior vice president for marketing and strategic
planning at the unit.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Allen is also said to be eager to show lower-level, highly
regarded executives that AT&T is a big company that nonetheless
offers quick advancement. It's still unclear from today's
announcement what additional moves he will make, however.
</p>
<p>
   Some of the biggest changes may come in Mr. Mandl's new group,
the giant Communication Services. Said to be in line for a promotion
or new, more highly visible assignment is Joseph Nacchio, now
president of AT&T Business Communications Services, which posted
almost $20 billion in revenue last year.
</p>
<p>
   A combative marketer and major AT&T tactician, Mr. Nacchio kept
AT&T competitive in the business market against a relentless
marketing assault from MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp.
</p>
<p>
   Some insiders said Mr. Mandl may eventually ask Mr. Nacchio to do
the same for the similarly sized AT&T Consumer Communication
Services, now headed by Merrill Tutton. The Consumer unit's "i Plan"
for residential customers, which one analyst likened to the
inscrutable Infinity car ads of a few years ago, has failed to stem
losses of millions of customers to MCI's snappy "Friends & Family"
and Sprint's sleeper-hit "The Most."
</p>
<p>
   "Stay tuned," said one person familiar with AT&T's management
moves. "More changes are coming."
