@  Firms Use Contracts and Cash to Prevent
@  Talent Raids by Departing Executives

<p>
   Infuriated by talent raids staged by departing executives, many
big companies are erecting elaborate new anti-defection defenses.
</p>
<p>
   The motive is self-preservation: Jobhopping executives can wreak
considerable havoc by recruiting trusted lieutenants. "It can be
terrible to lose one executive. But when several leave, a company
can be devastated," says Joseph Bachelder, a New York lawyer and
executive-pay specialist.
</p>
<p>
   To prevent that, a number of companies "are taking out their
golden handcuffs and anything else they can to chain top performers
to the wall," notes David B. Radden, a senior vice president with
recruiters Paul R. Ray & Co.
</p>
<p>
   At Compaq Computer Corp., for example, executives forfeit special
pension plans if they try to recruit talent when they leave.
American Express Co. has established employment agreements for many
executives that include noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements.
And Paine-Webber Group Inc.'s money-management unit, Mitchell
Hutchins Institutional Investors Inc., recently gave stars more
money to sign employment agreements, which tie them to the company
for at least 18 months.
</p>
<p>
   The Mitchell Hutchins contracts were drawn up after the company's
president, Stephen E. Canter, left in April to join Kleinwort Benson
Group PLC; nearly one-quarter of the portfolio managers followed,
and Mitchell Hutchins lost some important accounts.
</p>
<p>
   At General Motors Corp., new anti-defection defenses were
occasioned by the departure of J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, head
of GM's European purchasing operations; in March, Mr. Lopez bolted
for Volkswagen AG and took along seven key managers.
</p>
<p>
   In the aftermath of Mr. Lopez's departure and raid, GM
accelerated the implementation of a bonus plan that was first
developed last year. A special committee of GM outside directors now
determines how and when bonuses are awarded to about 500 top
managers. The committee can grant, say, 25% of an executive's bonus
at year end and the balance when he or she retires.
</p>
<p>
   GM officials decline to disclose specific amounts awarded so far.
But it is safe to say that managers who prematurely jump ship may
forfeit millions of dollars in bonuses. That makes it nearly
impossible for a former executive to recruit former colleagues, says
Judith Fischer, publisher of Executive Compensation Reports, a
newsletter in Fairfax Station, Va.
</p>
<p>
   Similarly, Micron Technology Inc. in Boise, Idaho, spreads out
its managers' annual bonuses over five years. The electronics maker
created the plan in 1985 to keep executives from job hopping. Any
executive who quits Micron before retirement loses the unawarded
portion of the bonus. Company officials say that the plan was
developed to keep talent motivated but it also helps to prevent a
brain drain.
</p>
<p>
   Talent raids are hardly new in corporate America. Lee Iacocca,
Chrysler Corp.'s retired chairman and chief executive officer, lured
dozens of Ford Motor Co. managers for many years after he left the
latter company in 1978. One of the most spectacular raiding cases
happened in 1988 at Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein, a major
advertising agency in New York. Half of the agency's management team
walked out the door one day, leaving no one in charge. The
executives, who included the chairman and president, set up a
competing agency across the street and unabashedly began wooing
other Lord Geller employees.
</p>
<p>
   But such raids seem to be occurring more frequently today,
largely because there is so much turmoil in corporate America. When
an outside manager gets hired to deal with such problems, "he
usually wants someone he has worked with in the past and someone he
can trust," says Jay Conger, a Harvard University associate business
professor. Also, Prof. Conger notes, executives are changing jobs
more often than they did 10 years ago.
</p>
<p>
   Some executives strongly believe they have a right to recruit.
When they are "racing against the clock" to fix ailing companies,
executives must find the best people to help, Mr. Iacocca says.
"Many times, that's at the company where you worked before. It makes
them really mad. But that's the way business is."
</p>
<p>
   Some companies find that intense negotiations and counteroffers
can stem a management exodus. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. feared for
the stability of its senior management when its chief executive
officer, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., took the helm of International
Business Machines Corp. in March and tried to take along RJR's chief
financial officer and general counsel. RJR used vice-chairman titles
and sweetened compensation to block the defections of Karl von der
Heyden, its chief financial officer at the time, and Lawrence
Ricciardi, its general counsel.
</p>
<p>
   RJR board members also personally spoke with Mr. Gerstner. He
finally decided not to take the two men -- apparently out of a
desire to maintain amicable relations, according to an IBM official.
But Mr. Gerstner did snatch David Kalis, RJR's senior vice president
of communications.
</p>
<p>
   Other corporations are attaching punitive "bad boy" clauses to
executives' compensation agreements. For instance, Compaq's chief
executive officer, Eckhard Pfeiffer, and four other top executives
could each lose millions in benefits and a special pension fund if
they recruit just one Compaq employee when they leave the
personal-computer maker. The company says it developed the
agreements last year to guard better against the recruiting and job
switches that are so prevalent in the computer and software
industries.
</p>
<p>
   "Companies are trying to make it as painful as possible for
former executives to steal employees," explains Alan M. Johnson, a
compensation consultant in New York. "The best way to do that is to
put a very significant amount of money on the table."
</p>
<p>
   Preventive measures work best. That is why IBM recently devised a
stock-options scheme to keep 1,200 top managers. The plan lets these
managers swap old stock options for new ones. Because of IBM's
depressed stock price, most of these old options can't currently be
exercised at a profit. Under the plan, the managers must wait two
years to exercise half of the options and another two years for the
remainder. IBM figures that the stock plan will prevent a talent
exodus.
</p>
<p>
   Such practices make it difficult for former executives to "pry
loose other managers," says Matt Ward, a lawyer with Wyatt Co., a
compensation consulting firm.
</p>
<p>
   Courts offer businesses little help when an executive does attack
management's ranks, however. In May, GM lost a German court fight to
ban Mr. Lopez from taking the seven managers to Volkswagen. GM had
claimed that its competitive position would be damaged if Volkswagen
hired them. PaineWebber withdrew a suit it had brought against Mr.
Canter last month after the concern failed to find that the Mitchell
Hutchins president had acted improperly.
</p>
<p>
   "It's very difficult to win these cases," says Felice Ekelman, a
compensation lawyer with Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler & Krupman, a New
York management-law firm. "The Constitution protects us from
slavery. People have a right to work where they want."
