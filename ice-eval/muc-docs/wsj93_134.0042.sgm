   Last year's boom in the mutual fund industry was also
good for mutual fund chief executives' paychecks.
</p>
<p>
   A survey of 13 public fund company chief executives' total
compensation, compiled by New York newsletter Fund Action, found
that the median chief's pay increased 23%. The biggest gain, and
highest total compensation, went to John Nuveen CEO Richard Franke,
who took home $19.6 million. That total included a $16 million
restricted stock award when Nuveen went public last year.
</p>
<p>
   Two chief exexutives saw their pay decline. Bassett Winmill,
chief executive of Bull & Bear Group, saw his compensation fall 6%,
to $156,000. Mr. Winmill was the lowest-paid chief executive in the
survey.
</p>
<p>
   One fund chief executive who wasn't on the list was John Bogle,
head of Vanguard Group, the U.S.'s second-largest mutual fund group
and a firm owned by the shareholders of its mutual funds. Two
newsletters have estimated Mr. Bogle's 1992 compensation: In March,
Mutual Fund Forecaster estimated his pay at $2.7 million, and
recently Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors estimated it at
$3.3 million.
</p>
<p>
   The higher figure would have put Mr. Bogle as the fourth
highest-paid fund chief executive on the Fund Action list, after Mr.
Franke, Dave Williams of Alliance Capital Management ($9 million)
and Howard Stein of Dreyfus Corp. ($3.7 million). The lower figure
would have made him fifth highest, after Lawrence J. Lasser of
Putnam Investments, a subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan ($2.8 million).
</p>
<p>
   The compensation of most fund group chief executives -- including
Edward C. Johnson III, head of Boston fund giant Fidelity
Investments -- isn't available because the firms are closely held or
are subsidiaries of other firms.
