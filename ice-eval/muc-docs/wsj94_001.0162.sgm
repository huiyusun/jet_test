   Bad things are supposed to come in threes, and so do the examples
needed to flesh out a newspaper column. I don't know if there's a
connection.
</p>
<p>
   I do know that some curious things have bubbled to the top of the
sports pot in recent days. Baseballs are flying, a 1992 Olympic
gold-medal winner is sighing and the salary outlooks of some
National Football League stars are dying. That adds up to three,
doesn't it?
</p>
<p>
   1. The tip-off on this spring's baseball power surge came on
opening day in Chicago, when Karl "Tuffy" Rhodes, a young player of
modest measurements who'd hit a total of five home runs in parts of
four previous Major League seasons, hit three in his first three
trips to the plate. The batting barrage hasn't continued apace, but
it has continued. Through Sunday, American League hitters were
averaging .274 with 1,393 runs scored and 303 home runs, against
.267, 1,177 and 204 on the same date last season. The National
League numbers were .261, 1,198 and 259 against .250, 1,045 and 189.
</p>
<p>
   Conclusion-jumpers concluded that the baseball has been "juiced"
to give more bang to the bash. That's always the first explanation
when the lines on the hitting charts rise sharply, as they do from
time to time. Official denials quickly followed, also as usual.
</p>
<p>
   There are alternative explanations. April weather has been
unusually warm in many places, producing muscle-loosening
temperatures and hitter-friendly westerly breezes. All the
iron-pumping ballplayers have been doing might be paying off. Last
season's two-team National League expansion, which added 20 or so
pitchers' jobs in the Majors, has thinned the talent in the game's
most important position.
</p>
<p>
   This time the obvious answer appears to be the likely one: That
baseballs are being juiced to create the runs that the moguls
believe put fannies in the seats. Subtle factors do not account for
a 43% increase in home runs.
</p>
<p>
   But what, I ask, is so terrible about that? Professional football
is forever tinkering with its procedures in order to satisfy its
fans' scoring desires-of-the-moment. Goal posts are widened or
narrowed, field hash marks are changed, defensive backs are leashed
and unleashed. There'll be a two-point-conversion option beginning
next season. Compared with that, baseball has been the very model of
stability, for which we should be grateful. And besides, juice is
good for you.
</p>
<p>
   2. The Olympian with the problem is Mark Lenzi, who finished
first in men's three-meter springboard diving at the 1992 Summer
Games in Barcelona. It seems that, unemployed at age 25 after
retiring from competition, the Bloomington, Ind., resident wanted to
go to airline-pilot school but lacked the wherewithal, whereupon he
announced he might sell his medal to raise funds. No sale has been
made, but the offer added several-fold, via the TV-talk-show
circuit, to his Warholian portion of celebrity.
</p>
<p>
   I watched one of the shows and thought the hostess's line of
questioning was interesting. Did Lenzi feel "cheated" that other
former Olympians such as Nancy Kerrigan were reaping millions of
dollars from their celebrity while he was not? she asked. And did he
now regret the "countless hours" he'd devoted to his sport? To his
credit, Lenzi answered "no" to both questions, but he did allow that
he was perplexed by his present plight. "While I was in training, I
never thought I'd be doing this," he said.
</p>
<p>
   Several pertinent points did not come out in this interview. One
was that Lenzi's athletic skills had earned him a full scholarship
to Indiana University, from which he was graduated in 1990. Another
was that, after his college days were done, he received regular
training stipends from his sport's governing body and the U.S.
Olympic Committee. A call to the USOC also revealed that on two
occasions Lenzi had obtained jobs through the group's placement
program but subsequently left them both, that he hadn't availed
himself of offers of further placement help, and that, in 1992, he'd
lost out on a $2,500 "Opportunity Gold" grant because he failed to
do some routine paperwork.
</p>
<p>
   A broader point, I think, has to do with the expectations of
present-day athletes. Somehow, the notion has gotten around that
success in sports provides -- or should provide -- a magical "open
sesame" to the world's goodies. The fact is that, mostly, it's just
a line in the resume, albeit a very good one. Notices to that effect
should be posted on locker-room walls.
</p>
<p>
   3. The footballers experiencing potential paycheck trauma include
some of the game's biggest names: Richard Dent and Neal Anderson of
the Chicago Bears, Rodney Peete and Andre Ware of the Detroit Lions,
Mark Rypien of the Washington Redskins and Alvin Harper of the
Dallas Cowboys.
</p>
<p>
   Their obstacle is the NFL's per-team salary cap; new this year,
it was part of the 1993 labor agreement that also brought free
agency to the league. It's an honest-to-gosh ceiling, unlike the
National Basketball Association's, which lets teams pay whatever
they need to re-sign their own free agents. The football version
saves spendthrift teams (i.e., the San Francisco 49ers) from
themselves while giving owners an easy "out" from fan criticism that
they're not doing their darnedest to field a winner.
</p>
<p>
   Football salaries generally will rise from last season, but some
veteran players are finding the pickings slimmer. Much the same
thing happened in baseball this year as a result of a reduction in
national television revenue. Stars in their primes are still pulling
top dollars in both sports, and the many more at the bottom are
getting the contractual minimums. Players in the middle are being
squeezed.
</p>
<p>
   There's some irony here. For years, team athletes have been
telling us they're really entertainers and should be paid as such.
Now, it looks like they're going to be.
