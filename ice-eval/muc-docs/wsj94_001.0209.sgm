   SyQuest Technology Inc. next month will begin selling its
computer-cartridge disk drives under its own name for the first time
to target a broader market, David Everett, executive vice president
of sales and marketing, said.
</p>
<p>
   SyQuest makes removable cartridges that can store as much as 270
megabytes of data from a computer. The Fremont, Calif., company has
marketed its product mostly under the name of its dealers. In an
interview, Mr. Everett said the company will announce Monday it will
begin selling a new line of its cartridges under the SyQuest name
through retail stores, in an effort to target the mainstream market
for personal computers.
</p>
<p>
   SyQuest will sell the 3.5-inch, 270-megabyte and
105-megabyte-cartridges through national distributors such as
Merisel Inc. and Tech Data Corp., as well as superstore chains like
CompUSA Inc.
