   Armco Inc. said it will cut about 200 salaried positions, or 3%
of its total work force, in an effort to eliminate redundancies
between corporate and plant administrative positions.
</p>
<p>
   The specialty steelmaker projected that the cuts would save about
$15 million a year after they're completed in the fall.
</p>
<p>
   At its annual meeting, Armco also named John C. Haley, 64 years
old, chairman. Mr. Haley's appointment is for a one-year term,
during which Armco's board will study the concept of a nonexecutive
chairman. Mr. Haley, an Armco board member since 1975, is retired
chairman and chief executive officer of closely held Business
International Corp. He succeeds Robert L. Purdum, 58, who retired.

   In addition, Armco named Bruce E. Robbins, 49, and John D.
Turner, 48, to its board. Mr. Robbins is president and chief
executive officer of PNC Bank N.A., a unit of PNC Bank Corp. Mr.
Turner is president and chief executive of Copperweld Corp.

   With Mr. Purdum's retirement, Armco's board now has nine members.
