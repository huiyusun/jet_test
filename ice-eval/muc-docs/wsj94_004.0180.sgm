<p>
   Shares of the Roslyn Heights, N.Y., developer of
automated-software solutions closed up $3 at $25.75 on the American
Stock Exchange after the company said fiscal third-quarter net rose
82% to $10.3 million, or 26 cents a share, from $5.6 million, or 14
cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 92% to $27.1 million for the
quarter ended March 31.

   The stock had been volatile after the CNBC cable-television
network reported concerns about its price, the company's products
and selling by corporate insiders. The company denied that a
management shakeup was imminent.
</p>
<p>
   Eli Oxenhorn, chairman since 1987, will step down to pursue other
interests, but will maintain a consulting role for three years.
