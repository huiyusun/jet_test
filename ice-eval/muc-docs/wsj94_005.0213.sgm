   Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive officer
of Federated Department Stores Inc., certainly likes to shop where
he works.
</p>
<p>
   According to the proxy statement from the department store chain,
based in Cincinnati, Ohio, Mr. Questrom's salary and an additional
cash payment remained unchanged at $2 million for fiscal 1993, one
of the highest in general retailing. But his compensation also
included a whopping $168,301 in an "executive discount" on
merchandise purchased at Federated's stores, which include
Bloomingdale's, Burdines and Rich's, among others. A company
spokeswoman said Mr. Questrom took similar discounts in fiscal 1992.
</p>
<p>
   The spokeswoman said that, like executives at other retailers,
top Federated executives get a discount of roughly 40% off the
suggested retail price. She said that "a large portion" of the
purchases likely went to furnishing an old farmhouse in Connecticut,
which the flamboyant Mr. Questrom and his wife are restoring and
adding on to.
</p>
<p>
   Federated has been a solid performer under Mr. Questrom. In the
fiscal year ended Jan. 29, profit before charges grew about 48% to
$196.8 million. Under Mr. Questrom, Federated also bought a chunk of
R.H. Macy & Co. senior debt. Federated is now in talks with Macy
creditors on a reorganization plan that would merge the two chains.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Questrom signed one of the richest contracts in retailing in
1990. The proxy noted that Mr. Questrom was paid $2 million for
signing on as Federated chairman and is guaranteed both a $1.2
million salary and $800,000 "value-added payment" for each year of
his five-year contract. When his contract is up Feb. 2, 1995, he'll
be entitled to another payment based on any increase in Federated's
stock price during his five-year reign.
</p>
<p>
   Other Federated executives received smaller bonuses, which are
tied to the company's operating-profit level and "individual
performances" of executives. James Zimmerman, president and chief
operating officer, received a $1 million salary, but his bonus
dropped to $232,800 from $310,400 in fiscal 1992. He took $19,321 in
executive discounts.
</p>
<p>
   The salary of Ron Tysoe, Federated vice chairman and chief
financial officer, remained at $650,000, but his bonus dropped to
$185,7000 from $247,600 in 1992. He received $22,963 in shopping
discounts and $16,116 for a car allowance.
