   Platinum Software Corp. lost nearly two-thirds
of its market value yesterday, as investors dumped their holdings on
news of expected heavy operating losses and the surprise
resignations of four top executives.
</p>
<p>
   The announcement sent shares of this maker of financial and
business-information software tumbling $6.4375, or 64.4%, to close
at $3.5625 a share in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. A total of 4.2
million shares, a third of the 12.4 million outstanding, changed
hands yesterday.
</p>
<p>
   Platinum said it anticipates a "substantial loss from operations"
on revenue of between $13 million and $15 million for its third
quarter ended March 31. The company also said it plans to take a
one-time restructuring charge of between $7 million and $10 million
and will restate its financial results as far back as September
1991, resulting in a corresponding decrease to stockholders equity
-- which stood at $56.9 million on Dec. 31 -- of about $13 million
to $20 million.
</p>
<p>
   Platinum also announced the resignations of Chief Executive
Officer Gerald R. Blackie, 40 years old, Chief Financial Officer Jon
R. Erickson, 37, and executive vice presidents, Kevin P.
Riegelsberger, 36, and Timothy J. McMullen, 36, all of whom have
also left the board.
</p>
<p>
   Carmelo J. Santoro, 53, will act as interim chief executive and
Bruce C. Edwards, 40, will serve as interim chief financial officer.
They are the only directors remaining.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Santoro said the executives resigned their posts voluntarily,
after weighing the probable fallout from the restatement of
earnings.
