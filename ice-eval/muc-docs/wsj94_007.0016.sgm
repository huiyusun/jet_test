   MTC Electronic Technologies Co.'s
stock plunged to a 52-week low on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange Friday,
after the company disclosed a litany of troubles that have afflicted
its operations in China.
</p>
<p>
   After trading as low as $1.94 a share earlier in the day, MTC's
stock closed at $2.38 a share, down $1.13 on volume of 2.4 million
shares.
</p>
<p>
   The consumer electronics manufacturing and trading company, which
recently fired its chief executive and corporate secretary for
alleged financial improprieties, said it expects to report a
"substantial loss" for its year ended Jan. 31, 1994, reflecting
large write-offs and charges from its Chinese operations.
</p>
<p>
   The company revealed that its Dongugang paging system is having
software, billing and marketing problems; it said the system may be
overbuilt, hurting its short-term profitability prospects. And the
company said its Hubei cellular telephone system can't be activated
because it lacks handsets.
</p>
<p>
   MTC named a Chinese economic consultant as non-executive
chairman, succeeding fired chairman and chief executive Miko Leung.
Its new chairman, Li Kam Chung, is expected to manage activities
aimed at enabling MTC to conduct its joint venture in China and to
strengthen its government relationships there.
</p>
<p>
   MTC also said it started legal proceedings in Hong Kong against
several individuals, including its former chief executive and its
former corporate secretary. It said it is seeking to recover over
$10 million.
</p>
<p>
   The company said that the executives have been "completely
eliminated from all management functions" and that an executive
committee is "in full control of the company. . ." and is
reorganizing it.
