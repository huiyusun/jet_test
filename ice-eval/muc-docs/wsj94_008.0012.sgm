   Gerald Greenwald, the chief executive
officer-designate for UAL Corp., said he plans to accelerate the
development of a new short-flight operation, perhaps stepping up
aircraft orders, to better defend United Airlines in the industry's
most hotly competitive arena.
</p>
<p>
   In an interview, the 58-year-old former Chrysler Corp. official
also said he is personally leading the search for a new president,
and is shepherding the creation of a marketing campaign that would
stress employee ownership of UAL's United Airlines.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Greenwald, selected as the new top officer by United's labor
leaders late last year, will assume his post as chairman and chief
executive this summer if shareholders approve a proposed majority
buyout by employee groups, as expected.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Greenwald made his remarks following a meeting with analysts
and institutional investors here in which he and UAL's top officers
tried to drum up support for the more than $4.67 billion
equity-for-concession plan. The proposal has met with a lukewarm
response by major shareholders and analysts uncertain about the
future performance of the nation's first airline to be
majority-owned by employees.
</p>
<p>
   One of Mr. Greenwald's first challenges will be to address
United's short-haul operation. "We need to stop current inroads" by
Southwest Airlines and other low-cost rivals, he said, adding that
the plan outlined in the prospectus for the buyout isn't aggressive
enough.
</p>
<p>
   In the prospectus, which was prepared by current management,
Chicago-based UAL said it would create a separate shortflight
operation that would mimic Southwest's profitable, no-frills
business. The new airline, with a code name of U2, would be rolled
out no later than four to six months after the deal closes, and
would operate 130 aircraft within five years. Without offering
specifics, Mr. Greenwald said, "I'd like to start it faster and grow
it faster."
</p>
<p>
   "I don't expect to destroy Southwest," he added, "just make it
more painful for them to grow and compete with us."
</p>
<p>
   But the trick for Mr. Greenwald will be making the new program
fly profitably, and history isn't in his favor. "The aviation
graveyard is filled with Southwest me-toos," says Kevin Murphy, an
airline analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co. "It is difficult to copy,
and U2 isn't a success story just because it's now on paper."
</p>
<p>
   Seeking a right-hand officer, Mr. Greenwald said he is having
discussions with candidates "with significant experience" at other
major airlines. The search by Mr. Greenwald, a former vice chairman
of Chrysler, should blunt criticism that the proposed employee
buyout of UAL would leave the nation's largest airline with
inexperienced senior management.
</p>
<p>
   Under the equity-for-concession transaction, Stephen Wolf,
United's current chairman and CEO, and John Pope, president, will
resign. That would leave United firmly in the hands of Mr.
Greenwald, who is an unknown in the airline industry, having never
worked for a carrier before.
</p>
<p>
   Defending himself, Mr. Greenwald said, "I was part of the
turnaround of a $90 billion company {Chrysler} that is doing fairly
well today."
