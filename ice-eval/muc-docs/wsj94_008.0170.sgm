   Newspapers Avoid
   Naming Names
@
</p>
<p>
   NEWSPAPERS OFTEN don't give credit when it comes to corporate
sponsorship of sports and arts events.
</p>
<p>
   The International Events Group, which tracks and researches
corporate sponsorships, recently asked newspaper editors in 23 major
U.S. and Canadian cities for their policy on naming corporate
sponsors in articles.
</p>
<p>
   IEG found that 12 newspapers name sponsors only on a first
reference, while eight avoid a mention whenever possible. Three
papers had no policies or guidelines and name sponsors on a
case-by-case basis.
</p>
<p>
   The editors had various reasons for not using sponsor names. Some
cited avoiding free advertising, the event's age, readers' ability
to identify the event and strangeness of the sponsor's name. Take
the Poulan/Weed Eater Bowl, also known as the Independence Bowl.
</p>
<p>
   "How would you like to be a TV commentator who has to say that a
few times?" says Rebecca Rolfes, IEG's vice president of external
relations. "You're just looking for flubs on the air. On the other
hand, sponsors generally feel that there's a lack of accuracy. If
it's called the Poulan/Weed Eater Bowl, then it's got to be called
that in the paper."
</p>
<p>
   By not having a consistent policy when it comes to mentioning
sponsors, newspapers may discourage corporate sponsorship and
minimize the potential effectiveness of the exposure from a
sponsorship, says Lesa Ukman, IEG's president.
</p>
<p>
   John Hancock Financial Services thought it wasn't getting the
proper credit for sponsoring the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas. So the
company renewed its sponsorship under the condition that "Sun" be
dropped from the event's name, forcing journalists to refer to the
game as the John Hancock Financial Services Bowl. The move was
beneficial, the company said, because it ended up spending $1.6
million for about $5.1 million in advertising exposure.

   High-Tech Firms Aim
   For Higher Visibility
@
</p>
<p>
   HAVING THE LATEST and greatest specifications and features was
once enough to sell high-tech products. Not anymore.
</p>
<p>
   "As more and more products come to market, it all boils down to
the strength of the brand," says Cathy Martin, manager of marketing
programs at IntelliQuest, a marketing information provider.
</p>
<p>
   At the first Brand Tech forum last fall in Dallas, 250 people
attended to get tips on how to build and capitalize on a brand name.
This year's Brand Tech forum, scheduled for September in San Jose,
Calif., will address co-branding, where companies join forces to
develop a new brand or market an existing one.
</p>
<p>
   Many large high-tech companies, like Intel, Microsoft and Apple
Computer, have strong brand names. But smaller companies are getting
in on the act, trying to distinguish their products from the
competition.
</p>
<p>
   Applied Microsystems is a Redmond, Wash., manufacturer of
emulators that help engineers debug programs embedded in computer
microprocessors. It wanted a simple image that would raise awareness
about its product. So its ad agency last year developed a print
campaign featuring frogs, nature's debuggers. In one ad, the "Rocket
Frog" symbolizes a fast-performing emulator. In another, the "Rambo
Frog" represents an emulator that goes on "search-and-destroy
missions."
</p>
<p>
   "We're in a staid technical business, and using the frogs has
brought a persona to the company," says Bill McAlister, Applied
Microsystem's director of marketing. "Whenever we go to conferences,
people recall the ad. Now there's a high degree of association, and
it's a positive one."
</p>
<p>
   TechnoBranding is the word Chuck Pettis has service-marked to
describe this process. "People don't buy on logic alone," says Mr.
Pettis, principal of Floathe Johnson, the Washington ad agency that
developed the frog campaign. "They use rational decision-making, but
ultimately a lot of purchases are made on chemistry and having a
relationship with the product."

   City Buses Becoming
   Billboards on Wheels
@
</p>
<p>
   ADVERTISERS HAVE found a new twist on an old promotional vehicle.
</p>
<p>
   They're covering buses in 11 cities from headlight to taillight
in huge painted or vinyl ads that practically encase the bus.
</p>
<p>
   The vehicles have the advertising value of a blimp, the impact of
a billboard and the market penetration of a bus, according to
Transportation Displays, the New York City company marketing the
concept.
</p>
<p>
   Using a patented technique, the bus windows are covered by a
transparent material that is then painted. Passengers can see out,
but pedestrians and motorists can't see in. What they do see is a
rolling mural.
</p>
<p>
   The Phoenix Suns rented exterior space on five city buses to
advertise the basketball team's 25th anniversary. One of the more
attention-getting buses sported a glowering picture of star player
Charles Barkley. "We got a lot of calls from parents and other
people wanting to know what routes the painted buses were on so they
could ride or look for them," says Andrea Han, a spokeswoman for the
Phoenix transit authority. "These were the same buses on the inside
but people specifically wanted to know where they could catch the
`Charles Barkley' bus."
</p>
<p>
   Buying bus space is usually part of a broader marketing campaign,
says Jim Edwards, a senior account executive with the Cerine Coyne
ad agency in New York City.
</p>
<p>
   "There's no way to track whether we're getting direct results or
not, but it's another way to keep our clients top of mind," Mr.
Edwards says.

   SISKEL AND EBERT they're not, but Dallas Mavericks basketball
players Popeye Jones and Tim Legler are moonlighting as movie
critics. It's part of a promotion with the 75 local Blockbuster
Video stores. Before each home game, the two appear on the arena's
video screen to review and rate a movie available for rental at the
stores: 4 Hoops=Excellent.
