will create a bank holding company with assets of nearly $900
million. Both companies' shareholders are to get shares in Today's
Bancorp equivalent to the number of shares they held before the
merger. The current market value of stock in both companies is $93
million. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Northwest Illinois's shares
closed up 25 cents at $19.25, while FirstRock's shares closed
unchanged at $18.

   Northwest Illinois, based in Freeport, has assets of $417 million
and earned $4.4 million, or $1.65 a share, last year. FirstRock,
Rockford, has assets of $408 million and earned $4.2 million in its
fiscal year ended June 30. FirstRock went public in October 1992.
</p>
<p>
   Dan Heine, president and chief executive officer of Northwest
Illinois, will serve as chairman and chief executive officer of the
new holding company, while David A. Ingrassia, president and chief
executive of FirstRock, will be president and chief operating
officer.
</p>
<p>
   The merger, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals, is
to be completed in the fourth quarter.
