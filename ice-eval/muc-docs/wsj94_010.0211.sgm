<p>
   Two months ago when the State Department announced that it would
focus on the treatment of women in its yearly report on human rights
conditions, the New York Times reported that officials "denied" that
the White House played any role in this new emphasis.
</p>
<p>
   About the same time, the Justice Department, in a reversal from
earlier positions, sided with the state of California and against
Barclays Bank in a pending Supreme Court case on how states tax
foreign-based companies. This prompted suggestions that the White
House was interfering with the independence of Justice's solicitor
general.
</p>
<p>
   Two weeks ago White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers was
bombarded with questions at a press briefing on the propriety of the
White House intervening in a Justice Department review of a clemency
request for Jonathan Pollard, the former naval officer convicted of
spying for the Israelis.
</p>
<p>
   These three very diverse episodes share a common thread: the
insane implication that the president of the United States is not
supposed to set the policy of his own administration. This absurd
notion has accelerated in recent weeks in the frenzy of the
Whitewater scandal.
</p>
<p>
   The president should not get involved in individual regulatory
matters; that's why independent agencies -- with members appointed
by the president -- were created. But certainly the president is
supposed to direct the policy of his own administration. These
recent anecdotes are illustrative.
</p>
<p>
   Let's hope that the White House played a role in deciding whether
to emphasize the treatment of women in U.S. human rights policies.
That's not a decision that should be left to the striped-pants set.
</p>
<p>
   The Barclays Bank taxation case is too arcane for my feeble mind,
so it's an open question to me whether the administration is
correct. But in 1992 Bill Clinton campaigned in California on
precisely this position. Right or wrong, he got a lot more votes
than any bureaucrats in the solicitor general's office.
</p>
<p>
   As for complaints about any White House involvement in the
Pollard clemency case, critics ought to read a simple document:
Article 2 of the Constitution. It states the president "shall have
power to grant reprieves and pardons." That responsibility rests
exclusively with the office of president.
</p>
<p>
   In the current climate, one top White House assistant says, "We
hear footsteps every time we get involved in anything
controversial."
</p>
<p>
   The presidency, for all the desirable checks and balances,
shouldn't function with such inhibitions. "The president ought to be
actively involved in governmental decisions," says Terry Eastland, a
conservative former Republican Justice Department official and
author of an acclaimed book on the power and prerogatives of the
executive branch. "That's why we elect a president. That's what the
Constitution says he's supposed to do."
</p>
<p>
   To be sure, some of the problems were initiated by liberals in
the 1980s, especially in the judicial area, in an effort to stem the
conservative Reagan tide. But today some conservatives, sensing
weakness in an activist Democratic president, are seizing the moment
to try to hamstring executive prerogatives. This sort of situational
positioning is dangerously shortsighted.
</p>
<p>
   The most dramatic catalyst was the story revealing that top White
House aides George Stephanopoulos and Harold Ickes had expressed
displeasure to two top Treasury Department officials over the
appointment of Jay Stephens, a former Republican prosecutor, to
handle some of the civil matters of the Whitewater-tainted Madison
Guaranty. Yet a careful look at the particulars and the broader
question on whether the administration has sought to manipulate the
Resolution Trust Corp. to protect the president suggests there is
little basis for such overreaction.
</p>
<p>
   Jay Stephens is a former U.S. attorney of unbridled political
ambitions who was fired by President Clinton a year ago and then
blasted the president. Since then, he's been an actively partisan
Republican whose conduct concerning the investigation of Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski was so outrageous that his Republican predecessor as
U.S. attorney called his actions "unprofessional."
</p>
<p>
   It would have been unthinkable for any White House aide not to
complain about this appointment; imagine John Sununu or Ed Meese
timidly accepting the appointment of a ferociously partisan liberal
Democrat to investigate matters involving President Reagan or Bush.
But the most important point is that, private sniping aside, there's
no evidence that anything was done to remove Mr. Stephens. If
intemperate phone calls become a felony, we'll have to double the
national debt to build enough new prisons.
</p>
<p>
   And while it was clearly a bad idea to make Deputy Treasury
Secretary Roger Altman the acting head of the RTC, it doesn't appear
that this agency has been compromised by Clinton political
appointees. Indeed, the administration nominated a prominent
Republican, Stanley Tate, to head the agency last year; the
selection won praise from such diverse editorial pages as the
liberal Miami Herald and conservative Wall Street Journal. Mr. Tate
dropped out late last year when Senate Banking Committee Chairman
Don Riegle refused to move the nomination.
</p>
<p>
   Republican Rep. Jim Leach, the most serious and level-headed
Republican Whitewater critic, has alleged there has been political
pressure on RTC investigators. But last week the two top RTC career
officials, John Ryan and Ellen Kulka, wrote a letter to Mr. Leach
flatly asserting that "no pressure has been exerted" by the Clinton
administration on the Madison Guaranty and Whitewater
investigations.
</p>
<p>
   The bottom line is that an active Republican was nominated to
head the RTC, a vehemently partisan Republican has been tapped to
probe part of the Madison Guaranty scandal, and there is no
documentation of any pressure or action by Clinton appointees to
impede any investigation. On Whitewater, there remain some serious
unanswered questions about dealings in Arkansas a decade or more
ago. Not only is the special counsel in order but Congress ought to
swiftly pass the independent counsel law and Robert Fiske ought to
be reappointed as a truly independent counsel. Congressional
hearings are absolutely essential.
</p>
<p>
   But to leap from that to suggestions that this administration has
engaged in systematic abuses of power and that the authority of this
executive ought to be curbed is nonsense. Political opponents would
like to use this as an effort to paralyze President Clinton. But
they would do well to remember that's a weapon that not only can,
but invariably will, be turned on them once one of their own returns
to the Oval Office.
