   Sandoz AG announced a 14% jump in 1993 net income and
increased its dividend. The Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group
also appointed Rolf W. Schweizer chief executive officer.
</p>
<p>
   Although analysts widely expected a double-digit rise in
earnings, they said a dividend improvement of 23% to 58 Swiss francs
($40.62) a share from 47 francs was greater than expected.
</p>
<p>
   Sandoz also said its share capital would be simplified by
converting nonvoting participation certificates into registered
shares. The remaining two categories of registered and bearer shares
would be split in a ratio of 1 to 5.
</p>
<p>
   Sandoz's profit rose to 1.71 billion francs in 1993 from 1.5
billion francs a year earlier. The company said the growth was aided
by increased drug sales and improved margins in the
chemicals-and-environment sector.
</p>
<p>
   The appointment of the 63-year-old Mr. Schweizer as chief
executive also was unexpected. He will succeed Marc Moret, 70, who
kept the chairman and chief executive positions after Daniel C.
Wagniere, 57, became chief operating officer last year. Up until
then, Mr. Moret had held all three positions. Mr. Moret will
continue as chairman.
