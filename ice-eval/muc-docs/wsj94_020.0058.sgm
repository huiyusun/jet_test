   Citizens Inc. said it expects today to post fourth-quarter net
income of $1.6 million, or 10 cents a share, exceeding analysts'
estimates.
</p>
<p>
   A year earlier, the company earned $563,000, or three cents a
share, after a charge of $264,000, or two cents a share, on an
accounting change.
</p>
<p>
   In an interview, Harold E. Riley, chairman and chief executive of
the Austin, Texas, life-insurance holding company, said revenue rose
32% to $13.5 million, from $10.2 million.
</p>
<p>
   Analysts expected Citizens to post net income of about seven
cents a share, said Mark Oliver, the company's chief financial
officer.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Riley attributed the improved results to continued growth in
sales of its ordinary whole-life insurance policies to customers in
developing countries who have high net worth. He predicted revenue
will grow 20% to 30% in 1994.
