   Madison Group Associates Inc. said its
board dismissed Kenneth Lucas, president, naming Dean J. Trantalis
as interim president.
</p>
<p>
   The company also said two new directors -- Roland Breton and
Steve Gibboney -- had been appointed to its board.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Lucas became chief executive of the media concern less than
two months ago, when William T. Craig resigned from his job as a
director and chief executive officer.
</p>
<p>
   The company gave no reason for Mr. Lucas's dismissal. Neither he
nor Madison executives could be reached for comment.
</p>
<p>
   The management change is the latest in a series of events that
have shaken the company in recent months. As previously reported,
the Securities and Exchange Commission contacted several individuals
about their dealings with the company. One of those individuals said
the SEC had asked about how the company valued its assets.
</p>
<p>
   Those assets consist largely of video libraries. According to a
recent securities filing, an accountant formerly hired by Madison
recommended that an independent specialist be hired to evaluate the
video libraries.
