   Michael Walsh stepped down as chief executive officer
of Tenneco Inc. after telling directors that treatment he's
receiving for a brain tumor is impairing his ability to run the
company.
</p>
<p>
   The company's board, meeting by telephone conference call
yesterday until after the close of New York Stock Exchange trading,
elected Dana Mead, 58-year-old president and chief operating
officer, to the additional post of chief executive. Mr. Walsh had
recruited Mr. Mead in 1992 to join Tenneco.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Walsh, 51, who remains chairman, will be on indefinite
medical leave. "We all hope he will recuperate and return, but we
don't know," said Arthur House, vice president, corporate affairs.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Mead's succession was expected, the timing wasn't and Mr.
Walsh's decision came as a surprise to some of his closest
associates.
</p>
<p>
   Last month, Mr. Walsh underwent surgery to remove dead tissue
remaining from his brain tumor, discovered last year, and at the
time the company said his prognosis was favorable. "I think we were
all encouraged, and we're saddened," said Mr. House.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Walsh's doctors tell him the cancer isn't back, but he told
directors that the cumulative effects of surgery, chemotherapy and
other treatments have been more demanding than expected. Mr. Mead
said that Mr. Walsh, who he hasn't seen since late January, has
sounded "fatigued" in recent telephone conversations, and has
described continuing weakness on his left side. "The most recent
operation was to take care of that by relieving pressure from the
nerves. But those symptoms are persisting."
</p>
<p>
   The suddenness of Mr. Walsh's announcement left Tenneco uncertain
as to whether it will name a new president and chief operating
officer, or whether Mr. Mead will retain those titles.
</p>
<p>
   It's uncertain how Wall Street will react to Mr. Walsh's leave.
The day Tenneco announced in the summer of 1991 that he was to join
the company, the stock price surged $3.25 a share. In composite
trading yesterday on the Big Board, Tenneco fell $1.375, or 2.4%, to
close at $56.625.
</p>
<p>
   At Tenneco, Mr. Mead's responsibilities grew quickly, including
heading up the company's largest subsidiary, Case, a long-troubled
farm and construction-equipment maker. Mr. Mead was credited with
returning Case to profitability, posting a 1993 operating profit of
$82 million, vs. a loss of $260 million a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
   Tenneco is a diverse company with interests that include
natural-gas pipelines, automotive parts, packaging, chemicals and
shipbuilding. In 1993, the company reported net income of $426
million, or $2.44 a share, on revenue of $13.26 billion.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Walsh was diagnosed as having a midgrade brain tumor in
January 1993 and he underwent a treatment of radiation and
chemotherapy.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Mead has frequently functioned as chief executive officer
since Mr. Walsh's illness was diagnosed. He presented the company's
year-end 1993 financial results to Wall Street analysts earlier this
month and he has been in charge since Mr. Walsh's follow-up surgery.
</p>
<p>
   The new chief executive is a self-described compulsive organizer
who always carries three briefcases on business trips. "One is for
Case, another is Tenneco `have-to-do' stuff, and the third is
reading material" such as a biography of Theodore Roosevelt and
David Halberstam's book on the culture of the 1950s, he said.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Mead said he doesn't plan major changes, at least not
immediately. "We have Tenneco on a terrific trajectory. Our cost
structure is improved, our business positions are better and we have
cleaned up our balance sheet. We have financial flexibility that we
didn't have before. We're ready to enter a new phase-sustained
growth."
