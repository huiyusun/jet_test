   Ethyl Corp. announced specifics of its plan to
spin off its wholly owned chemicals subsidiary, Albemarle Corp.,
whose products include bromine chemicals, olefins and derivatives.

   Ethyl shareholders of record Feb. 28 will receive one share of
Albemarle for each two shares of Ethyl common stock, with
certificates to be mailed March 10.

<p>
   Albemarle will have its executive offices in Richmond and
administrative offices in Baton Rouge, La., and its shares will be
traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ALB. Ethyl
said it has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that
the spinoff will be tax-free to Ethyl and its shareholders.

   Albemarle's 1993 sales were $903 million; it will operate
manufacturing plants in Arkansas, South Carolina, Texas, Belgium and

   Ethyl's remaining businesses will include fuel and lubricant
additives produced at plants in Illinois, Mississippi, South
Carolina, Texas, Belgium, Canada and Japan. Ethyl also will continue
to own Whitby Inc., a Richmond pharmaceutical marketer. Ethyl's
remaining businesses had 1993 sales of $1.03 billion with assets of
$920 million and about 1,700 employees.
