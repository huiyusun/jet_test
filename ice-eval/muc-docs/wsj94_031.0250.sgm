<p>
   Arkla Inc. said it plans to change its name to NorAm
Energy Corp.
</p>
<p>
   The company said the change is subject to shareholders' approval
at the annual meeting May 10.
</p>
<p>
   The company said that with the addition of Mississippi River
Transmission, Entex and Minnegasco, it has outgrown the geographical
boundaries suggested by the name Arkla.
</p>
<p>
   Arkla's three distribution divisions, Entex, Minnegasco and
Arkansas Louisiana Gas, as well as Mississippi River Transmission,
will retain their current identities. However, Arkla Energy
Resources and Arkla Energy Marketing will operate under new names in
conjunction with the corporate name change.
