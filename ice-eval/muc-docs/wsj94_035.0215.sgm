   A+ Communications Inc. said it plans to expand its paging-network
coverage in North Carolina and South Carolina within the next three
months.
</p>
<p>
   Elliott H. Singer, chairman and chief executive officer, said in
an interview that because the paging company reached a break-even
point in its operating cash flow in those two states it will now
work on "increasing the footprint" of its services there.
</p>
<p>
   "We plan to have coverage from the mountains to the sea within
the next 90 days," Mr. Singer said. Service will be expanded from
Lumberton and Wilmington, N.C., to Charleston and Hilton Head, S.C.
</p>
<p>
   For the fourth quarter, the Nashville, Tenn., concern expects to
report a net loss of about $65,000, or one cent a share, compared
with a net loss of $723,000, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier.
