<p>
   USA Waste Services Inc. said it agreed to acquire
Houston-based Envirofil Inc. in exchange for stock valued at $139.5
million.
</p>
<p>
   Both companies are in the solid-waste collection and disposal
business. The combined entity will retain USA Waste's name and
generate annual revenue of about $175 million, USA Waste said.
</p>
<p>
   Under the agreement, Envirofil shareholders will receive one
share of USA Waste's common stock for every five shares of
Envirofil's common stock outstanding. The transaction, which is
subject to shareholder approval, will increase USA Waste's stock
outstanding to 20.8 million common shares from 11.5 million common
shares.
</p>
<p>
   Donald F. Moorehead Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of
USA Waste, said the acquisition will position USA Waste for what the
company expects to be a consolidation in the solid-waste industry.
</p>
<p>
   After the merger, Mr. Moorehead, 43 years old, will continue in
his posts. Envirofil's president, David SutherlandYoest, 37, will be
president and chief operating officer of the combined company. USA
Waste's chief financial officer, Earl E. DeFrates, 50, will continue
in that position.
</p>
<p>
   USA Waste shares closed at $15, up 50 cents, in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading. Envirofil rose 12.5 cents to $3.125 in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
