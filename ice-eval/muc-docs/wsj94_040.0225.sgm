<p>
   An extraordinary shareholders meeting of AB Volvo in Gothenburg,
Sweden, elected Bert-Olof Svanholm chairman of the Swedish
automotive group, in line with an earlier proposal.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Svanholm is president of ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., an
engineering concern jointly owned by Asea AB of Sweden and BBC Brown
Boveri AG of Switzerland. He succeeds Pehr G. Gyllenhammar, who
resigned in December after the collapse of a plan to merge Volvo's
vehicle operations with those of French partner Renault SA. It was
not clear who would succeed Mr. Svanholm at ABB Asea Brown Boveri.
</p>
<p>
   Meanwhile, in a speech to shareholders, Volvo President Soeren
Gyll didn't give any clear indication of Volvo's strategy or the
future of the Renault alliance.
</p>
<p>
   He also said 1993 car sales rose to 311,000 cars, the first
annual increase since 1986. The upswing was mainly in Japan,
Southeast Asia and North America.
