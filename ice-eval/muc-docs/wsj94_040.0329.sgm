<p>
   Attorney General Janet Reno is expected to announce
soon the name of the special counsel who will examine matters
surrounding President Clinton's investment in Whitewater Development
Corp.
</p>
<p>
   A Justice Department official said the announcement may come as
early as today, "but that would be quite a push." Ms. Reno was
traveling between Friday and last night and planned to review names
upon her return.
</p>
<p>
   While she was away, a small group of department employees,
including Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann and
criminal-division chief Jo Ann Harris, have been contacting lawyers
to see whether they would be available for the post.
</p>
<p>
   Among those under consideration are Dan Webb, a former U.S.
attorney who was a deputy independent counsel during the Iran-Contra
probe, and former U.S. Attorney Robert Fisk.
