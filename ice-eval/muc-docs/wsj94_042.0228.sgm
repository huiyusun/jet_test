   Dollar Time Group Inc. said it ended its agreement to acquire A
Real New York Bargain, a privately held retailer based in New York,
in a transaction originally valued at $43.6 million.
</p>
<p>
   Dollar Time, a Hollywood, Fla., operator of 55 variety stores,
said the two companies disagreed on the direction of Dollar Time's
operations. Moreover, Dollar Time, in a statement, said it had
become "concerned" about the profitability of A Real New York
Bargain since the two sides agreed to join forces in November.
</p>
<p>
   As part of the original agreement, Joseph Sasson, chief executive
officer of A Real New York Bargain, and Jeffrey Klansky, president
of the retailer, became chief executive and president, respectively,
of Dollar Time, as well as directors. Yesterday, the two men
resigned their positions at Dollar Time.
</p>
<p>
   Dollar Time said Gary de Luca, 40 years old, the company's chief
operating officer, was named president.
