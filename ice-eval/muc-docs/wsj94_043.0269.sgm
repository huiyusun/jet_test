   Anthony F. Earley Jr., credited with recouping some
losses associated with another utility's failed nuclear plant, was
named president, chief operating officer and a director of Detroit
Edison Co., effective March 1.
</p>
<p>
   Prior to becoming president in 1989 of Long Island Lighting Co.,
Hicksville, N.Y., Mr. Earley, 44 years old, served as Lilco's
general counsel and was widely credited with steering the company
through the Shoreham nuclear-plant controversy. The utility decided
to close the facility in the face of mounting controversy and
litigation. Mr. Earley helped negotiate a deal with the state that
enabled Lilco to recoup most of its investment in Shoreham through a
series of rate increases through the 1990s.
</p>
<p>
   Because of his successes at Lilco, some analysts considered him
the heir apparent to William J. Catacosinos, 63, Lilco's chairman
and chief executive.
</p>
<p>
   "I'm surprised he's leaving when he could have been CEO in a few
years," said Barry M. Abramson, an analyst with Prudential
Securities Group Inc. "Maybe he can use his expertise in nuclear
issues at the Fermi plant, which seems very important to Detroit
Edison."
</p>
<p>
   His appointment comes as Detroit Edison is assessing the damages
caused last month by a fire at its Fermi 2 nuclear power plant in
Monroe, Mich. The company has said the resulting shutdown at the
plant could affect 1994 earnings.
</p>
<p>
   John E. Lobbia, 52, who formerly held the position of Detroit
Edison president, will continue as chairman and chief executive
officer of the utility.
</p>
<p>
   A spokeswoman for Lilco said the company would announce
succession plans for Mr. Earley's position at a later date.
