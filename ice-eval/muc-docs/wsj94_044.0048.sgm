   McCormick & Co., Sparks, Md., said fourth-quarter net income rose
16%, due to strength in its international, industrial and packaging
operations.
</p>
<p>
   Net for the quarter ended Nov. 30 rose to $40.5 million, or 50
cents a share, from the year-earlier $35 million, or 43 cents a
share. Sales rose 1.9% to $460.8 million from $452.2 million.
</p>
<p>
   Fourth-quarter results include a charge of two cents a share, or
$1.2 million, due to an increase in the federal corporate tax rate
and post-retirement benefits.
</p>
<p>
   Bailey Thomas, the spice company's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the company had a successful year despite onion costs,
unfavorable foreign-exchange rates, and weak economic conditions in
many markets. "We expect 1994 to be another good year," he said.
</p>
<p>
   For the full year, net income fell 23% to $73 million or 89 cents
a share, from the year-earlier $95.2 million, or $1.16 a share. The
latest year includes a $26.6 million, or 33 cent a share, charge for
cumulative effects of accounting changes. Sales rose 5.7% to $1.56
billion from $1.47 billion.
