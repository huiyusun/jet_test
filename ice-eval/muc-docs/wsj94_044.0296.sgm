<p>
   Mariner Health Group Inc. said it signed a
definitive agreement to acquire Pinnacle Care Corp. in a stock swap
valued at about $104 million.
</p>
<p>
   The deal would effectively double Mariner's revenue and extend
its geographic reach, the company said.
</p>
<p>
   Mariner, which expects to post revenue of about $70 million for
1993, provides subacute health care to patients who no longer
require the extensive services of an acute-care hospital but are too
sick to go home. Closely held Pinnacle, based in Nashville, Tenn.,
owns or manages 13 skilled nursing centers, operates 27 outpatient
rehabilitation clinics and contracts services to nursing homes. It's
expected to post revenue of about $70 million for 1993, Mariner
said.
</p>
<p>
   The pact is the latest in a series of combinations in the
health-care industry as providers move to position themselves for
the Clinton administration's proposed reforms. On Wednesday, Sun
Healthcare Inc., a nursing-home operator, agreed to acquire Mediplex
Group Inc., a provider of subacute care, for about $312 million in
cash and stock.
</p>
<p>
   Arthur W. Stratton Jr., chief executive officer and president of
Mariner, said the acquisition will extend Mariner's operations from
New England and mid-Atlantic states to the Southeastern region,
where Pinnacle has a strong presence.
</p>
<p>
   Under the agreement, Mariner said it will issue between 4.9
million and 5.5 million shares based on the price of Mariner's stock
before the transaction is completed. The $104 million acquisition
price is based on the $21.50 closing price of Mariner's shares in
Nasdaq trading yesterday. The company said it would issue 4.9
million shares based on that price.
</p>
<p>
   Pinnacle's management team will remain with the combined entity,
while Pinnacle's president and chief executive, J. George Harris,
will assume the positions of president and chief operating officer
of the new company. Dr. Stratton will remain chairman and chief
executive of Mariner.
</p>
<p>
   The acquisition has been approved by the boards of each company,
but still requires regulatory clearance and shareholder approvals.
The transaction is expected to be completed in April.
</p>
<p>
   Announcement of the planned acquisition was made after the stock
market closed yesterday; Mariner's shares were unchanged at $21.50.
