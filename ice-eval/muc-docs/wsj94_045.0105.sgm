   LONDON (AP) -- Lloyd's of London amended its offer to settle
claims from hard-hit investors, correcting a calculation error.
</p>
<p>
   The insurance market also extended its deadline for acceptance of
the 900 million-pound ($1.34 billion) settlement by two weeks to
Feb. 14.
</p>
<p>
   Lloyd's said nearly half of the 21,000 names, as Lloyd's
investors are called, will receive less than their original offer.
Some 12,000 names will receive an increased offer. Lloyd's said the
changes involve 20 billion pounds, but the total amount of the offer
remains unchanged.
</p>
<p>
   "There is no question of increasing the offer and if the offer
fails, we shall continue to help the names in settling their losses,
but it will not be in the form of another offer," Lloyd's Chairman
David Rowland said.
</p>
<p>
   Many names are facing bankruptcy as a result of insurance losses
in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Grouped into syndicates that
underwrite insurance policies, the names risked unlimited personal
financial liability in exchange for the chance to share profits.
</p>
<p>
   Many blame mismanagement and lack of regulation within the
insurance market for the losses. Members of Lloyd's who accept the
settlement offer will give up the right to bring legal action
against Lloyd's for damages.
