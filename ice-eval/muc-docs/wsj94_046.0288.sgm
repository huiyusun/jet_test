<p>
   Toys "R" Us Inc. named Michael Goldstein chief executive officer,
ending years of speculation about who will succeed Charles Lazarus,
the toy retailer's founder and chief architect.
</p>
<p>
   Robert Nakasone, formerly vice chairman and widely regarded as
the other serious contender for the top executive's job, was named
president and chief operating officer, both new positions.
</p>
<p>
   Analysts said they expect Messrs. Goldstein and Nakasone to
continue to pursue Mr. Lazarus's strategy of developing new ways of
selling children's products, while opening stores abroad, where the
concept of high-volume, low-priced stores that keep their warehouse
inventories low hasn't spread as widely as in the U.S. Mr. Lazarus,
who continues as chairman, is expected to retain a strong role in
guiding the Paramus, N.J., concern, which revolutionized toy
retailing and now controls about a fifth of the $14 billion U.S. toy
market.
</p>
<p>
   Although the 69-year-old Mr. Lazarus has no immediate plans to
retire, the appointment clearly puts Mr. Goldstein, who retains his
title as vice chairman, first in line to become the next chairman.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Goldstein, 52, made his mark by squeezing profits out of a
mature U.S. toy-retailing market through computerintensive control
of inventory and the ordering of products. Several large toy
supermarket chains, which couldn't cut costs as effectively as Toys
"R" Us, went out of business as a result.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Goldstein also may have won the position by turning around
Kids "R" Us, the company's once-struggling children's clothing
chain, said Sean McGowan, analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co.
Although sales improvements haven't been spectacular, operating
profit at Kids "R" Us has improved in the past two years, Mr.
McGowan said. He estimates that operating profit at the division for
the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 1994, will increase about 25%.
</p>
<p>
   For the past few years, Mr. Goldstein has fielded Wall Street's
questions on financial results at the end of each quarter. "I don't
know a senior executive at any other company with as great a memory
for detail" as Mr. Goldstein, said Mr. McGowan. "You call him up and
ask him, `What about that store?' If there's an issue involved, he
knows about it."
</p>
<p>
   "Retailers have asked me who was going to get Mr. Lazarus's job.
My feeling was that if Goldstein could turn Kids "R" Us, he would
get it," Mr. McGowan said.
</p>
<p>
   Meanwhile, the international side of Toys "R" Us' business -- of
which Mr. Nakasone, 46, has been in charge -- has been a bit
disappointing. Stock Falls on Overseas Results Yesterday, Toys "R"
Us said that sales for the eight weeks ended Dec. 25, its Christmas
selling season, increased 15% to $3.41 billion from $2.96 billion
for the same period a year earlier. Sales at stores open more than a
year rose 7.4%. But in a conference call with analysts later, the
company announced that overseas sales in the holiday season at
stores open more than a year were down 2.3% in local currency and
7.9% in U.S. dollars.
</p>
<p>
   The announcement caused the company's stock to drop in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. It closed at $40, down
87.5 cents.
</p>
<p>
   Analysts attributed the sales drop to weak foreign economies,
especially those in Germany, Japan and Spain.
</p>
<p>
   Although he is in the No. 2 position, Mr. Nakasone remains key to
the company's future growth, much of which it hopes will come from
abroad. Toys "R" Us has said it has plans to increase its market
share overseas, currently 2%, to approximately what it is in the
U.S., about 20%.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Lazarus, who will no longer be involved in the day-to-day
operations of the company, will devote more time to the
international part of the business, serving as a sort of ambassador
for Toys "R" Us, said Joseph Ronning, analyst for Brown Bros.
Harriman. One of Mr. Lazarus's new chores will be to visit with
foreign government officials "to create more level playing fields
for our stores abroad," Mr. Goldstein said.
</p>
<p>
   In addition, Mr. Lazarus also will pitch in domestically by
helping the company develop new merchandising concepts, such as
creating stores within stores. Two concepts already under way are
its Books "R" Us and Lego Boutiques.
</p>
<p>
   "You can be sure that if there's a major strategic opening or
testing of a new category, Charles will have a lot of input and may
be the final arbiter," said Mr. McGowan.
</p>
<p>
   Prior to joining Toys "R" Us in 1983, Mr. Goldstein was senior
executive vice president, operations and finance, at Lerner Stores
Corp. At Toys "R" Us, he has been executive vice president, finance
and administration, and chief financial officer. In addition to
cutting costs, Mr. Goldstein has pushed for the creation of special
boutiques within stores.
