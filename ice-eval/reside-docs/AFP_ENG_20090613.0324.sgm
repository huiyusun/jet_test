<P>
American Amanda Knox faced tough questioning Saturday while testifying for a
second day in a trial over whether she helped kill a British housemate who
refused to join in a group sex session in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Prominent public prosecutor Giuliano Mignini grilled the 21-year-old exchange
student accused of taking part in group sex play that turned violent with the
stabbing death of Meredith Kercher, 22, of Britain.
</P>
<P>
In a testy exchange, Mignini questioned Knox's assertion that interrogators had
extracted false statements from her by bullying her, calling her a "stupid liar"
and even hitting her on the head at one point.
</P>
<P>
Knox gave a description of hours of questioning in which she said that she was
told that if she did not tell the truth they would "throw me in jail for 30
years."
</P>
<P>
Defence lawyers repeatedly objected during Mignini's examination, accusing him
of badgering the witness and asking her leading questions.
</P>
<P>
Mignini focused on Knox's assertions that her false statements -- notably, that
her part-time employer Patrick Lumumba was the killer -- were the result of
"suggestions" during aggressive police questioning.
</P>
<P>
"Was Patrick's name indicated after they saw (her SMS) message (to Lumumba) or
just like that?" Mignini asked, sparking a heated row with the defence team that
judge Giancarlo Massei had difficulty quelling.
</P>
<P>
Knox said she became so confused after "a steady crescendo ... of 'I don't
know,' 'you're a stupid liar,' 'maybes,' and 'imagines' that ... I was led to
believe I had forgotten things."
</P>
<P>
She added: "When I said 'Patrick' I actually started to imagine a kind of movie,
images that could have explained the situation, Patrick's face, then (Perugia's)
Grimana square, then my house" on the night of the murder.
</P>
<P>
Knox had said Friday that harsh questioning had also pushed her to state that
she was at home at the time of the murder and could hear Kercher scream.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Knox said, she spent the night with Sollecito at his flat, where they
smoked marijuana, had sex and watched a movie.
</P>
<P>
The two, who face 30 years in prison if convicted, have been held since a few
days after Kercher was found semi-nude with her throat cut in the house in the
walled medieval town of Perugia that she shared with Knox.
</P>
<P>
The case has sparked lurid headlines in Britain and Knox's hometown of Seattle,
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Publicity over the case has sparked fears that she would not have a fair trial,
and Mignini's motives have been questioned.
</P>
<P>
The powerful prosecutor is currently under indictment for professional
misconduct and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Kercher was murdered after refusing to join in an orgy
on the night of November 1, 2007, along with 20-year-old Rudy Guede, from Ivory
Coast.
</P>
<P>
While claiming innocence, Guede, who worked as a casual labourer here, opted for
a "fast-track" trial and has already been convicted and sentenced to 30 years
for his role in the murder.
</P>
<P>
In the prosecutors' scenario, Guede held Kercher down while Sollecito and Knox
stabbed her.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese Lumumba, who was held for two weeks before being released without
charge, is suing Knox for defamation and was present at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
The defendant said she was "very sorry, gutted, (when she learned) that Patrick
was still in jail because of me."
</P>
<P>
Lumumba's lawyer Carlo Pacelli told AFP later: "She is a very good actress."
</P>
<P>
Mignini was to be followed later Saturday by a lawyer from Kercher's family, who
are seeking 30 million euros (40 million dollars) from the alleged killers.
