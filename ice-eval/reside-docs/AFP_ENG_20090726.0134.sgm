Pakistani authorities have arrested a former member of parliament in connection
with the murder of a Polish engineer decapitated by Taliban militants in
February, a security official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that Shah Abdul Aziz
was arrested in May over his suspected involvement in the killing and was being
questioned but had not been charged.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested at his home in Karak, a remote town around 100 kilometres (60
miles) south of Peshawar, the capital of Northwest Frontier Province.
</P>
<P>
On July 16, Pakistani police arrested another man, Attaullah, in connection with
the killing and on Sunday arrested three other people suspected of links to
Stanczak's murder and of plotting militant attacks in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
"These suspects were arrested in the light of a statement given by Attaullah
during interrogation," a senior security official said, requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot say at this stage that these people were involved in the murder of
the Polish engineer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Police recovered hand grenades, pistols and ammunition during the raid on their
hideouts in the Barakahu area on the outskirts of Islamabad, he said.
</P>
<P>
Geologist Piotr Stanczak, 42, was working in Pakistan for a Polish oil and
natural gas exploration company when he was seized in the volatile northwest of
the country last September. His abductors killed his driver and his bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
His decapitation on February 7 -- which was filmed by his captors and was the
first of a Pole by Islamic militants -- provoked a furious reaction from Warsaw,
which accused Islamabad of "apathy" over tackling terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Poland has offered a 290,000-dollar reward for information leading to the
capture of the Taliban militants who beheaded Stanczak.
</P>
<P>
Warsaw had also requested US assistance to help capture Stanczak's killers.
</P>
<P>
Poland is a close ally of Washington and has sent hundreds of troops to
Pakistan's neighbour Afghanistan to battle the Taliban there as part of a NATO
force.
