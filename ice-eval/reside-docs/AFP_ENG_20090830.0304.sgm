Two soldiers were wounded in a bomb explosion in the restive southern Philippine
island of Jolo Sunday, the military said.
</P>
<P>
The improvised explosive device exploded early evening near the airport on Jolo,
in the country's southern tip and a known stronghold of Al-Qaeda-linked Abu
Sayyaf militants, the military said.
</P>
<P>
Both soldiers belonged to the army's engineering brigade. They were being
treated at a military hospital but the extent of their injuries was not readily
known.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for planting the improvised bomb, but previous
attacks have been blamed on the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place amid a stepped up military operation against the group,
which has been blamed for the country's worst terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is believed to have splintered into smaller groups hiding in the
jungles around Jolo. In January, they seized an Italian, a Swiss national and a
Filipina who were on a Red Cross humanitarian mission on the island.
</P>
<P>
Two were freed in April, but the last hostage, Eugenio Vagni of Italy was freed
only after six months in captivity.
