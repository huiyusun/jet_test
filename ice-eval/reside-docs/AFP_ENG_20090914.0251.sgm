<P>
The trial of US exchange student Amanda Knox accused of killing her British
housemate during a drug-fueled sex game gone awry in 2007 resumed Monday in the
central Italian university town of Perugia.
</P>
<P>
Defence lawyers failed in a bid to have the case thrown out because of a long
delay in being given access to crucial DNA evidence, Italian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Central to the prosecutors' case against Knox and her then boyfriend Raffaele
Sollecito is the supposed murder weapon, a knife found in Sollecito's apartment
allegedly bearing Knox's DNA on the handle and the victim's DNA on the blade.
</P>
<P>
The trial resumed in the medieval walled town after a two-month summer recess.
</P>
<P>
Knox and Sollecito are accused along with a third defendant -- already convicted
and sentenced to 30 years in jail -- of killing 22-year-old Meredith Kercher
after she refused to join in a group sex session.
</P>
<P>
While claiming innocence, Rudy Guede of Ivory Coast, who worked as a casual
labourer in Perugia, had opted for a so-called "fast-track" trial limited to
evidence from the probe.
</P>
<P>
Both Knox and Sollecito have been held since a few days after Kercher was found
semi-nude in a pool of blood with her throat cut in the house in Perugia that
she shared with Knox.
</P>
<P>
In the prosecutors' scenario, Guede held Kercher down while Sollecito and Knox
stabbed her.
</P>
<P>
Kercher's family are seeking 30 million euros (40 million dollars) from the
alleged killers.
</P>
<P>
Two judges and six jurors will decide the fate of Knox and Sollecito, who face
30 years in prison if convicted. A verdict is expected later in the year.
