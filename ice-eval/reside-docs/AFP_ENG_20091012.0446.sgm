The Abu Sayyaf group, which was set up in the 1990s allegedly with seed money
from Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network, has been blamed for a string of
kidnappings in the Philippines.

Police also said they suspected the Abu Sayyaf may be responsible for the
kidnapping on Sunday of an Irish priest, Michael Sinnott, 78, in the troubled
south of the country.
