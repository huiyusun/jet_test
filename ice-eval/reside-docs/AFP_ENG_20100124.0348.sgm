<P>
The top official ensnared in a mafia crackdown in southwest China will go on
trial in February, state press reported Sunday, the latest in a series of
sensational mob trials that have gripped the nation.
</P>
<P>
Wen Qiang, a former top judicial official in Chongqing municipality, will be
tried on February 2, as the city of over 30 million seeks to wrap up scores of
cases linking the government to organised crime, the China News Service said.
</P>
<P>
Wen, who also served for 16-years as a top Chongqing police official, stands
accused of protecting an intricate web of businessmen, officials and mobsters in
a case involving sordid tales of sex, gambling and graft in the city.
</P>
<P>
Besides being charged with accepting bribes and owning huge amounts of money and
assets he could not explain, Wen, 54, has also been charged with rape, People's
Daily reported last week.
</P>
<P>
Other defendants to be tried with Wen include his wife and at least three top
former Chongqing policemen, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the mafia crackdown in Chongqing began last June, charges have been
brought against 782 people in 78 cases, including 87 government officials, the
report said. Over 3,300 have been detained in the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Wen shielded businesses in numerous sectors such
as real estate, transportation, gambling and prostitution as well as an illegal
loan racket worth 30 billion yuan (4.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
A once defiant Wen -- who amassed assets valued at over 100 million yuan by
allegedly taking kickbacks from crime bosses -- had confessed to his crimes and
expressed remorse since his arrest, the Yangzi Evening News reported last year.
</P>
<P>
He has also confessed to affairs with his female underlings, as well as trysts
with Chinese entertainment starlets, some of whom he allegedly raped, the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
The confession of his infidelities sparked his angry wife to lead police to a
hidden cache of 20 million yuan buried in a remote rural fish pond, numerous
press reports said.
</P>
<P>
Wen's sister-in-law, Xie Caiping, was sentenced to 18 years in prison last year
for running up to 20 gambling dens in Chongqing hotels and paying off police to
turn a blind eye to her criminal activities that included illegal drug use.
