The head of a US-based charity, who along with nine other members are being held
in Haiti for allegedly trying to take 33 children out of the country, said
Sunday that the group's aims were entirely altruistic.
</P>
<P>
"We came here literally to just help the children. Our intentions were good,"
Laura Silsby, head of an Idaho-based charity called New Life Children's Refuge,
told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to help those who lost parents in the quake or were abandoned," she
said in her detention cell.
</P>
<P>
The director of the Haitian center where the children are being cared for said
earlier Sunday, however, that most of the youngsters insist their parents are
still alive.
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to help children that had no one else to care for them," Silsby
said from the police detention facility near Port-au-Prince's international
airport.
</P>
<P>
The US embassy here said the group were being held for "alleged violations of
Haitian laws related to immigration."
</P>
<P>
Police arrested the five men and five women with US passports, as well as two
Haitians, as they tried to cross into the neighboring Dominican Republic with 33
children late Friday.
</P>
<P>
Silsby declines to provide further details of their detention, and said she did
not know how the group's case would proceed under the Haitian justice system in
the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Haitian officials have voiced fears that child traffickers could take advantage
of the chaos after Haiti's massive January 12 quake to slip out of the country
with children in illegal adoption schemes.
</P>
<P>
There is also concern that legitimate adoption agencies may rush to take
earthquake orphans out of the country before proper checks have been conducted
to confirm their parents perished.
