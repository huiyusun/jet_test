<P>
The most senior official charged in a major crackdown on organised crime and
graft in southwestern China went on trial Tuesday in the climax of a lurid,
sensational court marathon.
</P>
<P>
Wen Qiang, former director of the justice department in the giant city of
Chongqing, stands accused of accepting bribes, protecting mafia rings and four
counts of rape, a court statement said.
</P>
<P>
He was being tried along with his wife and three top police officials in
proceedings that began early Tuesday and were expected to last five days, said
the statement by the No. 5 Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Wen, 54, along with his wife Zhou Xiaoya, is accused of accepting 15 million
yuan (2.2 million dollars) in bribes.
</P>
<P>
Previous state press reports have alleged that Wen, who was also once a top-
ranked Chongqing police department official, raped a string of women including
B-list film and music starlets.
</P>
<P>
Such lurid details, along with widespread speculation the crackdown was linked
to political manoeuvring at the apex of the ruling Communist Party, have gripped
the nation since trials began late last year.
</P>
<P>
The case has come to symbolise China's struggle against rampant corruption and
expanding organised crime.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party has railed against graft for years, seeking to counter
public anger over regular reports of larcenous officials and stories of excess
and debauchery among party leaders.
</P>
<P>
President Hu Jintao himself has repeatedly warned that graft threatens to
undermine the party's legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown is widely seen as a bid by Bo Xilai -- who was appointed party
secretary of Chongqing in 2007 and is considered one of the party's most popular
and charismatic figures -- to move up in the national hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
Bo, a former commerce minister and son of revolutionary elder Bo Yibo, is
believed to be angling for a spot on the nine-member Politburo Standing
Committee, the top national leadership, said China politics analyst Willy Lam.
</P>
<P>
"Bo Xilai is making a last-ditch bid to get into the Politburo Standing
Committee in 2012. He is 60 years old, so this is probably his last chance,"
said Lam, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At least seven people have been reported executed or sentenced to death in the
trials, which have shocked the public by exposing the impunity enjoyed by mafia
kingpins as they terrorised Chongqing and lived debauched lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
In November, Wen's sister-in-law Xie Caiping, 46, was sentenced to 18 years in
prison on charges ranging from running illegal gambling dens to drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the "Godmother" by Chinese media, Xie reportedly drove a Mercedes-Benz,
owned several luxury villas and kept a stable of 16 young men to provide her
with sexual services.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown also has seen a former senior judge who was awaiting trial, 57
-year-old Wu Xiaoqing, hang himself in jail, state media reports said in
November.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of the public interest in the case, the court received applications
from 72 media organisations from across the nation seeking to attend Wen's
trial, according to cqnews.net, a local Chongqing news website.
</P>
<P>
Crowds were seen outside the venue of Wen's trial on Tuesday but no disturbances
were reported amid heavy security.
</P>
<P>
During previous trials, crowds have gathered outside Chongqing courthouses, with
some claiming to be victims of the mobs and calling for harsh punishment for the
accused, earlier press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Metropolitan Daily, quoting people close to the case, said  Wen's
trial would be open for the first four days but closed on the fifth as it hears
the rape charges, to protect the identity of those involved.
</P>
<P>
It said that despite the reports of Wen assaulting entertainment starlets, he
was likely only to be tried for raping a college student whose name has not been
revealed.
