The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility on Sunday for a suicide attack on a
police station in the northwestern district of Karak that killed 4 people
including two policemen.

In addition to the dead, more than two dozen people were wounded, most of them
police officers, when an attacker detonated a pick-up van on Saturday at the
gate of the main police station in Karak, in North-West Frontier Province.

"We have done this," Taliban spokesman Azam Tariq told AFP by telephone from an
undisclosed location. "Both the police and army are equal for us. Both are our
enemies. They are responsible for the cruelties on us. We will carry out more
such attacks against police."

Karak lies 150 kilometres (94 miles) southeast of Peshawar, the capital of
North-West Frontier Province.

The Pakistani Taliban have claimed and been blamed for most of the bomb and
suicide attacks to have taken place in Pakistan. Such attacks have killed more
than 3,000 people since July 2007.

Pakistan's military has launched a number of offensives against militants in the
tribal belt, which according to the United States has effectively become the
headquarters of Al-Qaeda.
