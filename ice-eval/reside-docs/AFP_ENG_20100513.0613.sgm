The sole survivor of a Libyan plane crash that killed 103 people may be nine-
year-old Ruben van Assouw from Tilburg in the southern Netherlands, a local
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We received a telephone call" from officials to say that the boy, being treated
in a Libyan hospital, mentioned the name "Ruben", his grandmother An van de
Sande told the Brabants Dagblad as the foreign ministry confirmed that two
presumed family members of the injured child were on their way to Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Ruben had been on safari in South Africa with his brother Enzo, 11, mother
Trudy, 41, and father Patrick, 40, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one Dutch citizens were believed killed when an Afriqiyah Airways plane
coming from Johannesburg disintegrated on landing around 6:00 am (0400 GMT) at
Tripoli airport on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Van de Sande said she and other family members had waited for news at a Brussels
air field the whole of Wednesday, "and so I haven't yet seen the television
footage" of the bruised boy in his hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
"Other family members have seen it, but it is difficult to be 100 percent sure
that it is indeed Ruben.
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand it. It's like we're in a movie."
</P>
<P>
Dutch officials said Wednesday the child had undergone surgery for broken bones
and his condition was not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokesman Francesco Mascini would on Thursday not confirm the
survivor's identity "until the two presumed family members have seen the child".
</P>
<P>
Mascini said the two family members had left on a government plane around 6:00
am (0400 GMT) from the port city of Rotterdam, and would make their way to the
hospital on arrival in Tripoli later in the morning.
</P>
<P>
"Until the presumed family members have seen the child, we cannot say anything
about his identity with certainty."
</P>
<P>
Also on board the plane were forensic experts and consular staff to help
identify the dead and provide support on the ground, said Mascini, as well as
experts from the transport ministry to "help determine the cause of the crash".
Dutch tourism federation ANWB said Wednesday that 61 Dutch citizens, part of two
separate tour groups on their way to Brussels and Duesseldorf, Germany died in
the crash, but this figure has not been officially confirmed.
