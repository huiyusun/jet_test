US authorities have been able to visit on five occasions the American contractor
arrested in Cuba in December whom Havana claims is a spy, despite a US denial, a
State Department spokesman said Wednesday.

<P>
"We have been granted access to Alan Gross in Cuba five times, the most recent
consular access being on May 25th," spokesman Philip Crowley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"And we continue to ask that Mr Gross be released immediately, on humanitarian
grounds, and be allowed to return to his family," the US spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Gross worked for an NGO contracted by the State Department to supply computer
and communications material to civil society groups on the island, according to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Cuba insists however he is a spy who had sophisticated communications equipment
for dissidents in the Americas' only one-party Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
The US company that employed the contractor, Development Alternatives Inc.
(DAI), also denied the espionage charges.
</P>

Gross was arrested December 5, reportedly while distributing cell phones,
laptops and other communications equipment.
