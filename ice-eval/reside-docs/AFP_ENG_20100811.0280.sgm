A court in China has sentenced to death two leaders of a prostitution ring which
forced hundreds of women to work in brothels in the southwestern city of
Chongqing, state media said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ziqi and Tao Minggu were convicted of operating nine brothels disguised as
teahouses, beauty salons and hotels in the mega-city of more than 30 million
people between 1994 and 2009, the official China News Service said.
</P>
<P>
The court convicted Wang, Tao and another 28 members of the criminal gang on
charges of organising prostitution, false imprisonment, bribery and rape.
</P>
<P>
The report did not provide details on the other sentences.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is female, and Tao used the front companies to hide their illegal
earnings, which exceeded 100 million yuan (14.7 million dollars), the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of women were forced to work as prostitutes, it said.
</P>
<P>
The gang bribed a number of government officials to protect their illegal
racket, including Chen Tao, a former senior police official who has been jailed
for corruption.
</P>
<P>
Chen was an associate of Wen Qiang, the former head of Chongqing's judiciary and
an ex-deputy police chief who was executed last month for charges including rape
and taking bribes to protect gangs.
</P>
<P>
Wen's death brought to a climax a crime crackdown that lifted the lid on the
seamy underworld in Chongqing and has resulted in more than 3,300 detentions and
hundreds of prosecutions.
