A Pakistani cabinet minister Thursday presented a report to President Asif Ali
Zardari recommending a pardon for a Christian mother of five sentenced to death
for blasphemy against Islam.
</P>
<P>
Asia Bibi was sentenced to hang in Pakistan's central province of Punjab earlier
this month after being found guilty of insulting the Prophet Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Rights activists say Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law, under which the
offence is punishable by death, encourages Islamist extremism in a Muslim
country on the front line of the US-led war on Al-Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
"The report recommended pardon for Asia Bibi and suspension of the sentence," a
government statement said after minority affairs minister Shahbaz Bhatti
presented the document to President Zardari at a meeting in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
It said the report "concluded that the blasphemy case against Asia Bibi has been
registered on grounds of personal enmity".
</P>
<P>
The document recommended providing security both to Bibi in prison and to her
family, who say they have gone into hiding because of death threats.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting Bhatti, who himself is a Christian and was commissioned by
Zardari to investigate the case, said the minority community "has great respect
for all the Holy Prophets and the Holy Books," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The people belonging to minorities as a marginalised community know fully well
the consequences of blasphemy and could never think of committing the offence,"
it quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president asked Bhatti to draw up a committee to propose reforms to the
blasphemy law to "effectively prevent the misuse of (it) for personal and
political reasons," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Pope Benedict XVI last week called for Bibi's release and said Christians in
Pakistan were "often victims of violence and discrimination."
</P>
<P>
Punjab governor Salman Taseer on Sunday was the first senior government official
to appeal to Zardari for clemency after visiting Bibi in prison.
</P>
<P>
The case began in June 2009 when Bibi was asked to fetch water while out working
in the fields. Muslim women labourers objected, saying that as a non-Muslim, she
should not touch the water bowl.
</P>
<P>
Bibi was later arrested by police and prosecuted after Muslim women complained
that she made derogatory remarks about the Prophet Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Rights activists and pressure groups say it is the first time that a woman had
been sentenced to hang in Pakistan for blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
Only around three percent of Pakistan's population of 167 million are estimated
to be non-Muslim.
