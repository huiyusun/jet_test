A federal judge in Connecticut is expected to sentence a former business executive in connection with an accounting scandal at insurer American International Group Inc.

John Houldsworth is the former chief executive officer of an Irish affiliate of Berkshire Hathaway's General Re. He has asked the judge for probation and no fines. Houldsworth pleaded guilty to conspiracy to falsify SEC filings.

Prosecutors say AIG paid Stamford, Connecticut-based Gen Re in a secret deal to take out reinsurance policies with AIG in 2000 and 2001, leading to propped up stock prices and inflated reserves that cost AIG shareholders more than $500 million.

<P>
Prosecutors are asking for leniency for Houldsworth because his cooperation helped convict five other executives.
