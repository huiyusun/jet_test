Five French tourists got a harrowing start to their New York visit: a wild police chase.
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the visitors, seeking a taxi, were instead steered toward an unlicensed van at John F. Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Police saw the tourists being taken to the unauthorized van. An officer reached through the van window to take the keys. But the driver sped off, knocking the officer to the ground. Other police chased the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Esther-Ethy Mamane, of Paris, told the New York Post that she and her fellow passengers "screamed and prayed."
</P>
<P>
She says it was "like something from a film."
</P>
<P>
The van sped along a highway and residential streets, hitting a gate and a truck. The suspects jumped out while the van was still moving. Officers, with guns drawn, quickly arrested them.
</P>
<P>
One passenger, 60-year-old Claudie Mamane of Paris, suffered an arm injury.
