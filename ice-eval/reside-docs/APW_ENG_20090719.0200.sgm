Hundreds of marines and army troops have been deployed to two islands in the southern Philippines for a new offensive aimed at eradicating al-Qaida-linked Abu Sayyaf militants by the end of this year, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 120,000-strong military has tried but failed to finish off the 400-member Abu Sayyaf in the past.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro ordered the military last week to launch new assaults against the Abu Sayyaf on Jolo and Basilan islands after the militants freed Italian hostage Eugenio Vagni -- the last of three Red Cross aid workers who were kidnapped on Jolo in January.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old Vagni, who was freed July 12, returned Saturday to his hometown of Montevarchi, which welcomed him with an open-air party in a piazza. The Abu Sayyaf earlier freed his colleagues, a Swiss and a Filipino.
</P>
<P>
Without any hostages to worry about, government forces can now carry out more offensives, regional military commander Maj. Gen. Benjamin Dolorfino said.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf also appear to be suffering recently from infighting, making them more vulnerable to attacks, Dolorfino said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to finish this soonest. That's our order," Dolorfino told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner, however, said troops have been given up to December to eradicate the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
A marine battalion of about 500 men was deployed Saturday to Basilan, where more than 60 Abu Sayyaf militants are based. An army reconnaissance company of about 100 soldiers was also shipped Saturday to nearby Jolo, where more than 300 militants are hiding, Dolorfino said.
</P>
<P>
About 200 members of a police special action force are being trained in southern Zamboanga city prior to deployment to Basilan in a few weeks, Dolorfino added.
</P>
<P>
A week ago in Basilan, the Abu Sayyaf beheaded a member suspected of being a military spy. The internal purge sparked fears among many militants. A key Abu Sayyaf commander in Jolo also opposed the kidnappings of the Red Cross workers for still-unclear reasons, Dolorfino said.
</P>
<P>
He said American counterterrorism forces will continue providing intelligence to help Filipino troops fight the militants.
</P>
<P>
Major offensives have failed to finish off the Abu Sayyaf in the past. A monthslong U.S.-backed campaign in 2006 called "Oplan Ultimatum" killed Abu Sayyaf chieftain Khadaffy Janjalani and other commanders but other leaders emerged and took charge.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations because of bombings, ransom kidnappings and beheadings of hostages. The group is suspected of receiving funds and training from al-Qaida.
