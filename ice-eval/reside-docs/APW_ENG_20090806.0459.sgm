Neighbors and friends mourned the losses of three women killed in a shooting rampage during an exercise class at a Pittsburgh-area gym as the shooter's online diary revealed a man who was ignored by women and referred to an "exit plan" to avenge his rage.
</P>
<P>
George Sodini went to a sprawling L.A. Fitness Club, turned out the lights on the Tuesday night "Latin impact" dance-aerobics class for women, and opened fire with three guns, spraying dozens of bullets before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
"He just had a lot of hatred in him and (was) hell-bent on committing this act, and no one was going to stop him," Allegheny County Police Superintendent Charles Moffatt said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
His 4,610-word Web diary appeared to be a nine-month chronology of his plans to end his misery with a shocking act of carnage at his gym. He couldn't understand why women ignored him, despite his best efforts to look nice. He hadn't had a girlfriend since 1984, hadn't slept with a woman in 19 years.
</P>
<P>
"Women just don't like me. There are 30 million desirable women in the US (my estimate) and I cannot find one. Not one of them finds me attractive," the 48-year-old computer programmer lamented.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear when the Web diary was posted and whether it had been updated online repeatedly since November or posted in its entirety recently.
</P>
<P>
The violence rocked the town of about 5,300 people just outside Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
Killed were Heidi Overmier, 46, of Carnegie, a sales manager at an amusement park; Jody Billingsley, 37, of Mount Lebanon, who worked for a medical-supply company; and Elizabeth Gannon, 49, of Pittsburgh, an X-ray technician at Allegheny General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
"She can't be gone," said Gannon's next-door neighbor and close friend, Carl Rady, who knew her for 35 years and said she loved to work out and pamper her dog. "It can't happen that way."
</P>
<P>
Six patients remained hospitalized, including the aerobics instructor, Mary Primis, 26, who was listed in fair condition. Primis is pregnant but said doctors told her the baby is fine.
</P>
<P>
Sodini did not have a relationship with any of his victims, according to police.
</P>
<P>
In his Web diary, Sodini wrote of planning the attack since at least November and said he tried to carry it out when the same weekly aerobics class met Jan. 6 but "chickened out," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
His anger stemmed from unfulfilled desire: The women at his gym "look so beautiful as to not be human," he wrote. He complained that women "don't even give me a second look ANYWHERE" even though he was tan and fit and claimed to dress well and smell nice.
</P>
<P>
He listed his status as "Never married." In a chilling addition, he recorded the date of his death as Aug. 4, 2009.
</P>
<P>
On that evening, he walked into the health club wearing black workout gear and a headband, and entered the class with multiple guns.
</P>
<P>
Jordan Solomon, 14, said she thought it was weird when a man walked into the all-female class and put a black duffel bag on the ground and reached into it.
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden all the lights went out and I turned around, he started firing. I turned around and I saw him holding a gun," she said. She ran out of the room and into the parking lot, bolting into a restaurant where she told the workers to call 911.
</P>
<P>
Sodini did not have a criminal record, and he legally bought the guns he used, police said.
</P>
<P>
Sodini's family issued a brief statement: "Our hearts and prayers are with the victims and their families and we pray for the full recovery of the survivors."
</P>
<P>
Sodini graduated in 1992 from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in computer science and had worked as a systems analyst at a Pittsburgh law firm since 1999.
</P>
<P>
A neighbor, Connie Fontanesi, said Sodini was so anti-social that "we really didn't learn anything personal about him."
