The University of Pittsburgh says it won't accept an estimated $225,000 bequest from the gunman who committed suicide after killing three women and wounding nine others at a Pittsburgh-area health club.
</P>
<P>
Court papers of the intended estate gift were filed Friday by the brother and executor for 48-year-old George Sodini. University spokesman Robert Hill rejected the offer on Tuesday.

<P>
Two women injured in the Aug. 4 shooting an L.A. Fitness club intend to sue Sodini's estate. Lisa Marie Fleeher and Ashley Ferragonio filed notices Tuesday in Allegheny County court.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Henry Sneath says both women have undergone surgery and are recovering, but face additional surgeries.

<P>
Sodini graduated from Pittsburgh in 1992 and named the school as beneficiary in a 2007 will.
