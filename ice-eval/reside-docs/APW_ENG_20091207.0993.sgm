A prosecutor says he does not plan to charge the owner of a chimpanzee that mauled and blinded a woman.
</P>
<P>
Connecticut State's Attorney David Cohen said Monday that there is no evidence that Sandra Herold of Stamford was aware of risk that her chimpanzee posed to other people and disregarded it.
</P>
<P>
The 200-pound (91-kilogram) chimpanzee went berserk in February after Herold asked Charla Nash to help lure him back into her house. The chimp ripped off Nash's hands, nose, lips and eyelids.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that there was no record of the animal attacking anyone previously and that it had interacted with Nash many times before the attack.
</P>
<P>
Nash's family is suing Herold for $50 million and wants to sue the state for $150 million.
