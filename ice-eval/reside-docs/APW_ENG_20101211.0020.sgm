<P>
A jury Friday convicted a man of murder in the shooting death of an American Indian activist on a South Dakota reservation in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The jury found John Graham guilty of felony murder in the kidnapping of Annie Mae Aquash, whose death became linked to the American Indian Movement and its often-violent struggles with federal agents during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The jury acquitted Graham of premeditated murder, but Attorney General Marty Jackley, who prosecuted the case, said both murder charges carry a mandatory sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors alleged Graham and two other AIM activists killed Aquash because they thought she was a government informant. Graham's attorney, John Murphy, didn't call any witnesses but questioned the reliability of several prosecution witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Jurors took a day and a half to return its verdicts for Graham, a 55-year-old Southern Tutchone Indian from Canada, after briefly telling the judge late Friday that they had deadlocked on one of the charges. They soon returned with a decision on both counts.
</P>
<P>
During five days of testimony, prosecution witnesses testified that they saw Graham and two other AIM supporters, Arlo Looking Cloud and Theda Clark, tie Aquash's hands and place her in the back of a red Ford Pinto. The three took Aquash from Denver toward the Pine Ridge reservation, witnesses testified.
</P>
<P>
A key prosecution witness was Looking Cloud, who was convicted six years ago for his role in Aquash's murder and is serving life in prison. Looking Cloud said he stood nearby as Graham shot Aquash.
</P>
<P>
And two federal agents, former U.S. Marshal Robert Ecoffey and Bureau of Indian Affairs agent Mitch Pourier, said they saw Graham become nervous and talk about going to jail after they asked him about the murder in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But a number of expected prosecution witnesses -- including Serle Chapman, a British writer who interviewed Graham, and Thelma Rios, who pleaded guilty in November in connection with Aquash's kidnapping -- didn't take the stand.
</P>
<P>
Murphy questioned several prosecution witnesses -- particularly Looking Cloud -- on conflicts between their testimony and statements they had made before. Murphy accused Looking Cloud of embellishing his story and treating Graham like a "meal ticket" to a more lenient prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
AIM was founded in the late 1960s to protest the U.S. government's treatment of American Indians and demand the government honor its treaties with Indian tribes. It gained national attention in 1972 when it took over the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters in Washington but has since faded from public view.
</P>
<P>
The conviction comes after an investigation that started shortly after Aquash's body was found in February 1976. For years, witnesses refused to come forward. But authorities began to make progress in the 1990s, and Graham and Looking Cloud were indicted in federal court in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Graham was extradited four years later, but the federal charges against him were thrown out because neither he nor Aquash were American citizens. A state court then indicted Graham last year.
</P>
<P>
Aquash, a member of the Mi'kmaq tribe of Nova Scotia, was 30 when she died. Her death came about two years after she participated in AIM's 71-day occupation of the South Dakota reservation town of Wounded Knee.
