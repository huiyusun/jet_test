Lady Gaga isn't having much luck in Paris.

In October, the pop diva's concerts in Paris were postponed amid massive nationwide strikes over a government plan to raise the retirement age. One show was rescheduled for Sunday, but it was called off because of snow.

The weather led authorities to ban big trucks from driving through the Ile de France region that includes Paris. Concert venue Bercy stadium says on its Web site that Lady Gaga's trucks couldn't get to the venue on time.

Bercy says a concert Monday is expected to go forward as planned, and the canceled show is likely to be rescheduled for Tuesday.

The diva vented on Twitter, writing that "all 28" of the trucks carrying sets for her elaborate show had been detained.
