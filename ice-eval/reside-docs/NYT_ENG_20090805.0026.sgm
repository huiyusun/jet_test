      INTERNATIONAL ("i" code)

      NKOREA-U.S. (Washington) -- Looking at the state of North
Korea-U.S. relations after the trip by former President Bill
Clinton to win the release of two journalists. By Mark Landler.

      With:

      NKOREA-JOURNALISTS (Los Angeles) -- Former President Bill Clinton
arrived in the United States Wednesday morning after a dramatic
20-hour visit to North Korea, in which he won the freedom of two
American journalists, opened a diplomatic channel to North Korea's
reclusive government and dined with the North's ailing leader, Kim
Jong Il. By Jennifer Steinhauer.

      IRAQ (Baghdad) -- Prime Minister Nouri Kamel el-Maliki on
Wednesday ordered the removal of concrete barriers in Baghdad. By
Sam Dagher.

      PAKISTAN-TALIBAN (Islamabad) -- Four people, including a wife of
the Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud, were killed
Wednesday by what local residents said was a missile strike from a
remotely piloted American aircraft. The missile struck a house in
the remote Zanghra village in South Waziristan about 1 a.m.
Wednesday. Local residents reached by telephone confirmed that one
of the wives of Mehsud, the leader of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan,
was among those killed. Her name or age could not be confirmed.
Five others, including four children, were reportedly wounded in
the missile strike. By Pir Zubair Shah and Salman Masood.

      AFGHAN-VIOLENCE (Kabul) -- Six civilians were killed Wednesday by
a roadside bomb that bore the hallmarks of Taliban militants, while
American forces killed four people in southern Afghanistan who
residents said were also civilians. By Dexter Filkins.

      IRAN (Beirut) -- With his adversaries shunning the ceremony and
security forces on the streets, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was
sworn into office for a second term Wednesday, almost two months
after elections that divided the nation and sparked Iran's deepest
crisis since the Islamic revolution 30 years ago. By Robert F.
Worth.

      JAPAN-POLITICS (Matsuyama, Japan) -- The collapse of the
long-governing Liberal Democratic Party's base in the countryside
appears to be sending the party to a humiliating loss in the Aug.
30 national elections, which would knock them out of power for only
the second time since the party's founding in 1955. By Martin
Fackler.

      POPE-RECORD-DEAL (Undated) -- The pope has signed with Geffen
records for an album of him chanting and saying liturgy. By Daniel
J. Wakin.

      AFRICA-CLINTON (Nairobi, Kenya) -- Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton opened her seven-nation African tour in Kenya with
an address to a major U.S.-African trade conference and other
public events on Wednesday, in a visit intended to promote the
broad themes of good government, trade, food security and women's
rights. But Wednesday's events were shadowed by a subject of deep
international concern: Kenya's volatile politics. By Jeffrey
Gettleman.

      BRAZIL-SENATE-CORRUPT (Brasilia, Brazil) -- The pressure is
mounting on Jose Sarney, the president of Brazil's senate, to
resign his post amid corruption allegations. The departure of
Sarney, who heads the PMDB party and is a former Brazilian
president, could affect President Lula's majority coalition in the
senate, hampering the popular leader's ability to push through his
legislative agenda in his last year in office. Analysts and
opposition senators believe that controversial legislation to
redefine the country's oil industry could be in jeopardy. Some
senators have defined the struggle over Sarney as emblematic of an
aging generation of Brazilian politicians that abused their
positions to enrich themselves and family members. Sarney said
Tuesday that he would speak in his own defense on Wednesday on the
senate floor. By Alexei Barrionuevo.

      CHINA-CLIMATE (Beijing) -- China's envoy to global negotiations
on climate change expressed optimism on Wednesday that a new
agreement to reduce greenhouse gases will be reached this year, and
said that his nation's efforts to curb carbon pollution already had
produced results that he called "second to none." By Michael
Wines.

      CHINA-QUAKE-TRIALS (Beijing) -- Human rights advocates are
calling on the Chinese government to cancel the criminal trials of
two men who pushed for official investigations into the causes of
widespread school collapses during the devastating 2008 earthquake
in western China. The trial of one of the men began on Wednesday
but adjourned without a verdict. By Edward Wong.

      PHILIPPINES-AQUINO (Manila, Philippines) -- In a reminder of the
"people power" outpourings she inspired more than 20 years ago,
more than 100,000 people thronged the streets of Manila as the body
of former President Corazon C. Aquino was driven slowly through
swirling winds and rain for burial on Wednesday. For five days
after Aquino, 76, died of cancer on Saturday, crowds of mourners
converged on her coffin as it passed through the streets and lay in
state at Manila Cathedral. The banners, the tears, the clouds of
yellow confetti and the familiar chant of her name -- "Cory! Cory!
Cory!" -- went beyond mourning to political statement, as the
Philippines continues to wrestle with the democratic processes she
restored when she came to power in 1986. By Seth Mydans.

      SKOREA-AUTOS-RAID (Seoul, South Korea) -- South Korean police
commandos stormed a car factory on Wednesday using helicopters,
water cannons and tear gas in what the authorities hoped would be a
final push to evict hundreds of workers who seized the plant more
than two months ago to protest layoffs. But the workers who
remained holed up in the factory, the Ssangyong Motor Co. plant in
Pyeongtaek, 37 miles south of Seoul, refused to surrender, warning
that further police action could ignite thousands of liters of
paint thinner and other materials. By Choe- Sang-hun.

      NATIONAL GENERAL ("a" code)

      PA-GYM-SHOOTING (Bridgeville, Pa.) -- The man who opened fire in
a busy fitness center Tuesday evening, killing three women before
committing suicide, had planned the attack for months because of
frustration over his inability to find a girlfriend, according to a
diary he posted online. Two law enforcement officials confirmed
reports that the gunman was George Sodini, 48, of Scott Township, a
Pittsburgh suburb, and they said the diary appeared to be
legitimate, based on its contents. By Sean D. Hamill.

      U.S.-BIRTH-RATE (Undated) -- For the first time since the decade
started, Americans are having fewer babies and some experts are
blaming the recession. In 2006, the number of births in the United
States nearly tied a 45-year-old record high, set near the end of
the baby boom. Even more babies were born in 2007. But in 2008,
births began to decline nationwide, by nearly 2 percent, according
to provisional figures released last week. And this year, as more
families were feeling the effects of the recession, the earliest
monthly figures suggest that births decreased even faster. In the
first six months of 2009, 7 percent fewer babies were born compared
to the year before in Arizona, where the jobless rate rose from 5.5
percent to 8.7 percent in the year ending in June. By Sam Roberts.

      MASS-ADAMS-DIARIES (Boston) -- John Quincy Adams, president,
statesman and-- twitterer? The Massachusetts Historical Society on
Wednesday began posting snippets of the fifth president's diaries
on Twitter after a graduate student commented that they look like
today's tweets. By Katie Zezima.

      WASHINGTON ("w" code)

      OBAMA-DEM-GOVS (Washington) -- President Barack Obama heads to
Virginia on Thursday to make his first campaign stop on behalf of
R. Creigh Deeds, the gubernatorial candidate trying to keep the
state in the Democratic column. Earlier this week, Obama appeared
in a television advertisement of Gov. Jon Corzine, the New Jersey
Democrat who is struggling to win a second term. The Virginia and
New Jersey gubernatorial races are only big-ticket political
contests for 2009, so it was no doubt inevitable that they are now
being examined as an early measure of how Obama is doing, and a
sign of how Democrats might do in 2010. And while history suggests
off-year elections tend to be overanalyzed, the confluence of these
two contests is creating is creating a political dynamic that is
posing complications for the White House and potential headaches
for Democrats going into 2010. By Adam Nagourney.

      HEALTHCARE-REFORM (Washington) -- Daily developments. By Robert
Pear and David M. Herszenhorn.

      U.S.-SPACE-FUTURE (Washington) -- After listening to pleas from
space enthusiasts, a blue-ribbon panel reviewing the United States'
human spaceflight program started hashing out possible compromises
needed to fit out-of-this-world aspirations into a tight budget
box. By Kenneth Chang.

      FINANCIAL ("f" code)

      ECON-RDP (Undated) -- Two big sectors of the U.S. economy were
heading in opposite directions even as the recession showed signs
of nearing a bottom, economic figures released Wednesday indicated.
Manufacturers demonstrated some strength in June, as orders and
shipments for goods like metals, construction machinery, turbines
and electrical equipment posted a surprising increase, according to
new government numbers. But the country's service sector weakened
in July as new orders sagged and employment conditions worsened,
according to a private group's assessment. By Jack Healy.

      GOLDMAN-COMEBACK (New York) -- Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive
of Goldman Sachs, frequently tells the story about what happened
last fall like this: the flood of the century hit Wall Street and
Bear Stearns was on the first floor, Lehman Brothers on the second,
Merrill Lynch on the third, Morgan Stanley on the fourth and
Goldman on the fifth. The bottom floors were wiped out. The top
floors would have faced the same fate except for the fact that
someone stopped the flood. "It was a question of when the water
would stop rising," said two people who have heard the same story
from Blankfein. To most observers, that "someone" was the
government. By allowing Goldman and Morgan to become bank holding
companies, which gave them access to funds from the Federal Reserve
Bank and later, the ability to issue debt guaranteed by the
government, the government saved the two firms from collapse. Nine
months later, much of Wall Street is still reeling from the effects
of the storm. Goldman is not. By Jenny Anderson.

      HEALTHCARE-STANDARDS (Undated) -- The Obama administration and
lawmakers are urging a common-sense cure for the nation's faltering
health care system: persuading doctors to standardize how they
treat patients by using guidelines based on medical evidence. In
recent years, many insurers and health plans have adopted a similar
strategy, even paying bonuses in some cases to doctors who meet
standards like controlling blood-pressure or cholesterol. The basic
idea is that optimal treatment of these conditions will save money
by preventing serious disease. But while it may sound simple, the
strategy poses potentially serious difficulties that have not been
discussed much in this year's debate in Washington. In particular,
history suggests that it will not be easy to come up with
guidelines for doctors that are firmly grounded in scientific
research and that ultimately do more good than harm. Consider what
happened to one benchmark used in the treatment of diabetes, one of
the nation's most serious medical problems, and one of its most
thoroughly researched. By Barry Meier.

      CHINA-U.S.-EXPATS (Beijing) -- Shanghai and Beijing are becoming
new lands of opportunity for recent American college graduates who
face unemployment nearing double digits at home. Even those with
limited or no knowledge of Chinese are heeding the call. They are
lured by China's surging economy, the lower cost of living, and a
chance to bypass some of the dues-paying common to first jobs in
the United States. By Hannah Seligson.

      CISCO-EARNINGS (Undated) -- Cisco is to post its fiscal
fourth-quarter results after the market closes. By Ashlee Vance.

      NEWS-CORP-EARNINGS (Undated) -- News Corp. is to reports its
fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market closes. By Tim
Arango.
