KERMIT TYLER, 96, PLAYER OF A FATEFUL, IF MINOR, ROLE IN PEARL HARBOR ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They were only four words, but they made him a footnote figure
in a catastrophic day for America and shadowed him the rest of his
long life: "Don't worry about it."
</P>
<P>
It was a few minutes after 7 o'clock in the morning, Dec. 7,
1941. Lt. Kermit Tyler, an Army fighter pilot, was manning the
aircraft tracking center at Fort Shafter in Hawaii, near the vast
Pearl Harbor naval base, when he received a phone call from a
nearby radar station. Two Army privates watching the screen
reported picking up a large group of approaching planes.
</P>
<P>
It was only Tyler's second day at the tracking center; he had no
understanding of radar, had been given no specific orders on what
he was supposed to do and was accompanied by a lone Army private
serving as a telephone operator. A group of servicemen assigned to
plot the locations of unidentified planes had finished their
night's work and gone back to their barracks.
</P>
<P>
Tyler would recall how a friend once told him that a Honolulu
radio station normally off the air at night would be broadcasting
around the clock if American bombers were flying in from the
mainland, enabling them to beam in on the signal. He had heard
music on his car radio when he drove to his post hours earlier from
his beach house on Oahu's north shore. And he was aware that B-17
Flying Fortress bombers were scheduled to arrive that day.
</P>
<P>
"I knew the equipment was pretty new," Tyler said of the radar
scope in an interview with The San Diego Union-Tribune long
afterward. "In fact, the guy who was on the scope, who first
detected the planes, it was the first time he'd ever sat at the
scope. So I figured they were pretty green and had not had any
opportunity to view a flight of B-17s coming in. Common sense said,
Well, these are the B-17s. So I told them, 'Don't worry about it.'
"
</P>
<P>
The radar had picked up the first wave of the Japanese bombers
and fighters that began arriving over Pearl Harbor at 7:55 a.m. and
devastated Battleship Row, plunging the United States into World
War II.
</P>
<P>
Tyler was not disciplined for failing to follow up on the report
and went on to command fighter units in the Pacific during the war,
receiving the Legion of Merit. A career Air Force officer, he was
assigned in the mid-1950s to the Air Defense Command at Colorado
Springs. He had the rank of lieutenant colonel when he retired in
1961.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 23, his family announced, he died at his home in San
Diego. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
Tyler had been reluctant to speak about Pearl Harbor Sunday, but
he did grant interviews on occasion.
</P>
<P>
Kermit Arthur Tyler was born on April 21, 1913, in Oelwein,
Iowa. He grew up in Southern California and became an Army flying
cadet in 1936. After leaving military service, he obtained a
business degree and worked as real estate broker.
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his son, Terry, of Temecula, Calif.; his
daughters, Carol Daniels of Morro Bay, Calif., and Julie Jones of
La Mesa, Calif.; three grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.
His wife, Marian, died in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Gordon W. Prange, a historian who spent nearly four decades
researching the Pearl Harbor events, wrote that the Army private
who phoned the radar report to Tyler had "made one big mistake"
by not stating that the screen showed more than 50 approaching
planes.
</P>
<P>
Had he been given that information, "Tyler could scarcely have
mistaken it for a flight of B-17s," Prange concluded in his book
"At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor"
(McGraw-Hill, 1981), written with Donald M. Goldstein and Katherine
V. Dillon. "Such a number would represent a good slice of the
entire American inventory of this type of bomber."
</P>
<P>
Prange wrote that even if Tyler had notified a superior of the
radar report, little could have been done immediately beyond
dispersing planes parked closely together, easy targets for
Japanese bombers.
</P>
<P>
More serious, Prange maintained, was the failure that day by
anyone in the Army to tell the Navy of the radar sighting.
Revelation of the clear track of the approaching planes could have
helped the Navy find the Japanese carriers that had conveyed them
within striking distance, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Martinez, the National Park Service historian at the
Pearl Harbor memorial, persuaded Tyler to attend ceremonies there
marking the 50th and 58th anniversaries of the attack and to speak
of his decision to say "Don't worry about it."
</P>
<P>
"The words have their own infamy that has surrounded this
story," Martinez told The Honolulu Advertiser in 1999. "It's so
unfair."
</P>
<P>
But he added: "History doesn't allow you to escape an event as
large as Pearl Harbor. He was haunted by this."
