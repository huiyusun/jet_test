FOR DUTCH DEFENDER, PAY AND A PLATFORM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sky Blue FC's new Dutch defender, Daphne Koster, is the epitome
of a free agent.
</P>
<P>
She played for the AZ Alkmaar club in the Netherlands, where
women's soccer draws only a smattering of fans, and no paycheck.
Most of the top clubs, like Ajax, Feyenoord and PSV Eindhoven, do
not yet have women's teams.
</P>
<P>
Koster earned a modest salary from the country's soccer
association, employed as a "social worker" to the players on the
country's youth international teams. She only cost Sky Blue, the
defending champion in Women's Professional Soccer, the price of a
plane ticket.
</P>
<P>
"Women's football, I mean soccer, is always in the shadows
because in the Netherlands, the biggest sport is for the men,"
Koster said before Sunday's season-opening 1-0 win over Chicagoat
Yurcak Field on the campus of Rutgers in Piscataway, N.J. For the
record, the biggest women's sport in her native land is field
hockey.
</P>
<P>
"Coming here for me was a dream. I always thought it was a big
sport here. At home, the sport is not professional, the players are
either students or working. Me, I'm very happy with this
situation."
</P>
<P>
In the Netherlands, Koster's autograph is coveted by screeching
girls. But in New Jersey, it was more like the first day of school
wearing the orange home uniforms of Sky Blue which are the same
color as those of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"I felt pressure early in the game," Koster said after
Sunday's victory. "It was a difficult first game. There was more
communication in the second half, and I think we will work better.
But it was a good start."
</P>
<P>
The team's defense appeared shaky at times, making errant passes
and allowing a league-record 14 corner kicks by Chicago. The
first-year coach Pauliina Miettinen of Finland was not overly
pleased.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't pretty; I think we brought our B game," she said.
"Daphne is tough, can read the game, but she's in the toughest
league in the world and needs to make adjustments and communicate
better. That goes for all of us."
</P>
<P>
Koster vaulted into the sporting consciousness in the
Netherlands after leading the surprising Dutch women's team to the
semifinals of last year's European championshipin Finland, where it
lost to England in overtime. The team played a style that has been
called Tulip Catenaccio, a generally defensive, counterattacking
system, with Koster, the captain, anchoring the defense. She has
played 91 times for the national team and will miss some league
matches with Sky Blue as the Dutch attempt to qualify for the 2011
Women's World Cup in Germany. It is an acknowledged long shot, with
the Dutch in a qualifying group with powerful Norway. They next
play on April 22 at Macedonia. Only the first-place team will
advance to the next round.
</P>
<P>
Along with athletes like Ruud Gullit, Paul van Himst and Justine
Henin, she is a member of the committee that is seeking the 2018 or
the 2022 World Cup in a joint bid by the Netherlands and Belgium.
This week, she is being followed by a Dutch public television
network, which is working on a profile of her. The people from the
network have begun to call her Mrs. Einstein, playing off her
clutch of spiky blonde hair and the fact that she is living with a
family in Princeton, N.J., where the scientist Albert Einstein took
up residence after fleeing Germany in the 1930s. On Monday, Koster
was in Manhattan with her parents and boyfriend, the two-man TV
crew in tow.
</P>
<P>
"What is great here is that I'm not working and I can focus on
the game; it's so much better for me," Koster said. "I can
concentrate 100 percent. And it's such a challenge because this
competition is the best in the world. I play against the greatest
strikers here, players with technical ability who are big and
strong. Players like Marta, Kelly Smith, Tasha Kai and all the
American national team players. It is for me the best in the
world."
</P>
<P>
Koster, 29, is among Sky Blue's three new international players.
Joining Koster are the Swedish forward Jessica Landstrom, 25, and
the Finnish forward/midfielder Laura Kalmari, 30, who played in
college at Portland. WPS teams can sign up to five international
players.
</P>
<P>
This year, the league has players from 19 countries, up from 12
in its inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being followed by Dutch TV, Koster also writes a
weekly blogfor the newspaper De Telegraaf of Amsterdam. She is
among about 60 WPS players on Twitter some of whom tweet from the
sideline during games. On the field, Koster said her role was
"play clean and hold the ball, and to destroy."

NOTES
</P>
<P>
The new 12-team USSF Division-2 Pro League began play last
weekend. The league's 180 games will be streamed live, and free,
online from each team's Web site.
</P>
<P>
Major League Soccer has increased the size of the rosters for
its 16 teams to 26 players from 24 to accommodate two more of what
it calls homegrown players from youth academies. Teams are now
allowed to sign four players from their development academies
without exposing them to the league's annual draft.
