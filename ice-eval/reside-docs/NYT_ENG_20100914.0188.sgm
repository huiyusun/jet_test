The Italian police seized $1.9 billion in assets
belonging to a Sicilian businessman linked to the Mafia in the
country's biggest blow against organized crime, Italy's interior
minister said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The businessman, Vito Nicastri, mainly operates in the
alternative-energy business and has already been involved in
several investigations focused on Mafia infiltration in the
construction of windmills in Sicily's Trapani province and on links
between the Mafia and 'Ndrangheta crime associations in Calabria,
according to a statement by Rome Anti-Mafia Directorate. Italian
authorities seized Nicastri's assets to investigate him, but he has
not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
The seized assets included more than 100 properties around
Sicily, 43 companies operating mainly in the wind- and solar-power
industry -- some with headquarters in Luxembourg -- as well as luxury
cars, a 46-foot catamaran, bank accounts and securities.
</P>
<P>
"This is the proof of the fact that the Mafia is dynamic and
able to interpret the new needs of our society," said Francesco
Forgione, president of the parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission in
the previous government and author of the book "Mafia Exports."
</P>
<P>
"They all used to work a lot in construction and now the
Camorra operates in the waste business" -- he added, referring to
the Neapolitan crime syndicate -- "whereas the Mafia's in the
alternative-energy business."
</P>
<P>
The interior minister, Roberto Maroni, said in a television
interview Tuesday that Nicastri, 54, was "close to the Mafia boss
Matteo Messina Denaro, currently at large."
</P>
<P>
The Trapani investigation is part of a larger government
strategy targeting people investigators consider to be linked to a
new leader of Cosa Nostra, Matteo Messina Denaro. Originally from
Trapani, he has been a fugitive since 1993. He is known as the
"Boss of the Bosses" and the "Playboy Boss" because of his
penchant for fast cars, women and luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
In 2008, the government began stepping up its investigations
into organized crime and introduced laws that allow investigators
to seize assets connected to Mafia business before the criminal
trial starts. Several important raids against organized crime have
been carried out by police all over the country and have involved
different economic sectors, including health care, construction,
retailing and finance.
</P>
<P>
In August, Maroni said Italian police had seized 15 billion
euros in assets from organized-crime groups in the previous 14
months.
</P>
<P>
"On average, we arrested eight Mafia members a day and one of
Italy's most wanted men a month," Maroni said to Italian press
representatives.
</P>
<P>
However, critics say the government is working at
cross-purposes. Earlier this year, the government tried to pass a
bill that would restrict wiretaps used in criminal investigations,
a tool that many consider vital to fight organized crime.
