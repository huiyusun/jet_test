ROBERT KATZ, WHO WROTE OF NAZI MASSACRE IN ITALY, DIES AT 77
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Katz, an author and screenwriter who incurred the wrath
of the Vatican by accusing Pope Pius XII of failing to act to stave
off a Nazi massacre of Italians in 1944, died Wednesday in
Montevarchi, Italy, northeast of Siena. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
The cause was complications following cancer surgery, said his
wife, Beverly Gerstel Katz. Katz lived in Pieve a Presciano, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Katz, an American who lived in Italy for much of the last 50
years, wrote nonfiction books, novels and screenplays, many set
against the backdrop of 20th-century Italian history. He was
attracted to bloodshed and high drama.
</P>
<P>
One book, "Days of Wrath: The Ordeal of Aldo Moro" (1980), is
a journalistic recreation of the kidnapping of Moro, an Italian
statesman and former prime minister, from the center of Rome by
left-wing militants known as the Red Brigade, and of his eventual
murder. A 1990 book, "Naked by the Window," is a thoroughgoing
account of the 1985 death of the artist Ana Mendieta, who either
committed suicide by leaping from her 34th-floor Greenwich Village
apartment or was thrown from the window and killed by her husband,
the sculptor Carl Andre. Andre was tried for and acquitted in the
case.
</P>
<P>
Katz's 1977 novel, "Ziggurat," concerned terrorist
blackmailers threatening to detonate an atomic bomb at the North
Pole, and his screenplay for the 1976 thriller "The Cassandra
Crossing," which starred Richard Harris, Ava Gardner, Burt
Lancaster and O.J. Simpson, involved a plague-infected terrorist
fleeing the authorities on a passenger train.
</P>
<P>
But Katz's most frequent subject was the Holocaust, especially
as it pertained to Italy. In 2003, he published "The Battle for
Rome: The Germans, the Allies, the Partisans and the Pope,
September 1943-June 1944," an account of the German occupation of
Rome from the fall of Mussolini to the city's liberation. In many
ways it expanded on his first book, "Death in Rome," the one that
had brought him notoriety.
</P>
<P>
"Death in Rome" (1967) was a reconstruction of the infamous
Ardeatine Caves massacre of 1944, when the Nazis, in reprisal for
an attack by Italian resistance fighters on a German-speaking
police battalion, herded 335 Italian men -- prisoners and civilians
-- to a series of man-made caves on the outskirts of Rome and shot
them. In his book, Katz, citing evidence he later called strong but
circumstantial, said Pius had learned of the planned executions 19
hours before they occurred but chose to remain silent, an
accusation that was immediately denied by the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a book of history but a polemic in which the
special interests of the author are dominant and in conflict with
the interests of research and presentation of the facts," a
Vatican spokesman said at the time. (Among documents later released
by the Vatican, one indicated that Pius had, in fact, been made
aware of the Nazi reprisal, though only five hours before it took
place.)
</P>
<P>
The book was made into a film, "Massacre in Rome," in 1973.
The next year, in a legal proceeding initiated by the niece of
Pius, who had died in 1958, Katz along with the film's director,
George P. Cosmatos, and producer, Carlo Ponti, were charged with
"defaming the memory" of Pius. They were found guilty and given
suspended sentences. (Katz's was 14 months.) After several appeals
and counterappeals, the charges were set aside in 1980 by Italy's
highest court.
</P>
<P>
Katz was never one to shy away from assigning blame in
historical events or from drawing other potent conclusions, and his
work, though often admired for his research and writing style, also
drew fervent objections. His 1969 book, "Black Sabbath," about
the rounding up of 1,000 Roman Jews in October 1943 for liquidation
in Auschwitz, was praised as an "elaborately documented history"
by Michael M. Bernet, writing in The New York Times Book Review.
But Bernet also wrote that "Katz's attitude to Judaism, Jewry,
Zionism and Israel is hostile and uninformed, if not downright
offensive."
</P>
<P>
Robert Katz was born on June 27, 1933, in Brooklyn, where his
parents ran a grocery. He attended Brooklyn College and worked as a
writer on the staff of the American Cancer Society. He wrote
"Death in Rome" in New York City after a first trip to Italy; he
and his wife, whom he married in 1957, moved there permanently
after it was published.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife, he is survived by his sons Jonathan and
Stephen, both of Rome; his brothers Alan, of Manhattan, and Howard,
of Merrick, N.Y.; and two grandchildren.
