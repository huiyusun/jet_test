A Christian woman who was sentenced to
death by a municipal court for blasphemy against Islam could be
pardoned in the next few days by the president, a senior government
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Asia Bibi, 45, an agricultural worker and mother of five, is the
first woman to be sentenced to death for blasphemy, according to
human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab province -- where Bibi has
been held in jail for more than a year -- said he had forwarded a
petition presenting the facts of the case to President Asif Ali
Zardari on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taseer, a political ally of Zardari, said he believed that Bibi
had been unfairly treated since she was arrested in 2009.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the president will pardon Asia in a day or two,"
Taseer said.
</P>
<P>
The case against Bibi began in the fields of Ittan Wali, a
village 60 miles west of the city of Lahore, when agricultural
workers picking berries with her protested that she had been asked
by a landlord to fetch water for the workers to drink.
</P>
<P>
The other workers declined to touch the water bowl because Bibi,
a Christian, had carried the container, according to her husband,
Ashiq Masih, and other accounts.
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly she saw men and women walking towards her with angry
gestures," Masih, a laborer, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
"They started beating her and shouting that she had made
derogatory remarks against the Prophet Muhammad," he said.
</P>
<P>
A mob dragged his wife to a local police station, and there she
was charged with blasphemy and locked up, he said.
</P>
<P>
"My wife has not done anything," he said.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the guilty verdict this month, Judge Naveed Iqbal
ruled in a Punjab municipal court that the woman had not been
wrongly accused, saying in the verdict "the chances of false
implication of the accused are totally ruled out."
</P>
<P>
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has documented scores of
cases in which men have been harassed for being a Christian, or for
being a member of the Ahmedi sect, a minority group within Islam,
and then accused of blasphemy. The mere fact of being a Christian
or an Ahmedi in Pakistan makes an individual vulnerable to the
draconian blasphemy laws, the commission says.
</P>
<P>
Adding pressure to the Pakistan authorities to overturn the
sentence of Bibi, Pope Benedict XVI appealed last week for the
woman to be freed unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for President Zardari said that the petition from
Taseer had not reached the president's office yet.
</P>
<P>
"We know what to do," Farhatullah Babar, the president's aide,
said. "The president will take an appropriate decision when the
mercy petition is received."
</P>
<P>
It was also possible that the Lahore High Court could overturn
the decision, lawyers familiar with blasphemy cases said.
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups say more than 20 men have been sentenced to
death under the blasphemy law, most of them Christians.
</P>
<P>
None of these people have been executed. Under the blasphemy
law, a high court must confirm the death sentence from a lower
court, lawyers say. Some of those accused remained on death row
awaiting appeal to the high court, they say. Some mainstream
Muslims have also been charged with blasphemy, according to the
Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
Even if Bibi is pardoned, or if the Lahore High Court overturned
the sentence, there are concerns about her safety. Many people
acquitted on blasphemy charges continue to be hounded and are
forced to move, change their identity or hide, the commission says.
</P>
<P>
A 22-year-old man acquitted on blasphemy charges was shot to
death last week, two days after being released from jail. The man,
Imran Latif, was charged with desecrating the Quran.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial titled "Pakistan's Salem-witch-hunt" that
blasted the blasphemy laws, the English-language Daily Times
newspaper described the shooting of Latif as "sanctioning the free
hand of murderers."
</P>
<P>
Instead of denouncing the murder of Latif, the investigating
officer in the case had said "no Muslim tolerates a man who
commits blasphemous acts," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Many attempts have been made to revise the blasphemy laws,
including during the recent military rule of President Pervez
Musharraf. But lawmakers have stalled in the face of strong
opposition from religious parties.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was founded in 1947 as a Muslim nation but one where
its founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, said its citizens could practice
all religions freely.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s under the military dictatorship of Mohammad Zia
ul-Haq, the blasphemy law was introduced as part of the
Islamization of society.
</P>
<P>
"This is not Jinnah's law," Taseer said Monday, referring to
the contradiction between the intention of the nation's founder and
the blasphemy law. "We want Jinnah's Pakistan, not a mullahs'
Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
Taseer said the government expected a backlash against Islamic
religious leaders and extremist groups if Bibi was pardoned.
</P>
<P>
"We are struggling for Pakistan's soul," he said.
