CHIHUAHUA, Mexico - Armed men in military uniforms stormed the law offices of
Mario Gonzalez 10 days ago and whisked him away in a pickup truck. But the
kidnappers were after much more than money.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez has since appeared in two Internet videos, sitting handcuffed in a
chair, surrounded by five commandos in black masks, as they level automatic
weapons at his head. Then the interrogation begins.
</P>
<P>
"What group do you belong to?" barks an off-camera voice.
</P>
<P>
"The group called La Linea or the Juarez Cartel," Gonzalez answers on cue.
</P>
<P>
"What is your job?"
</P>
<P>
"I am the link to the prosecutor, my sister. . . . "
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old lawyer describes to the camera how he and his sister Patricia
Gonzalez, the former state attorney general, worked for the Juarez drug cartel
and orchestrated some of the state's most sensational political murders.
</P>
<P>
Patricia Gonzalez denies her brother's charges. He was being tortured, she said.
</P>
<P>
The videos have circulated widely on social networking sites, drug-war blogs and
Twitter. The abductors have promised a third and final installment.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez's kidnapping and his forced video "confession," with its similarities
to the propaganda produced by terrorists, represent a stark escalation in a drug
war that has left 30,000 dead over the past four years. The warring cartels
often accuse government officials of corruption but rarely in such al-Qaida-
style videos.
</P>
<P>
"They did it for revenge, because I would not negotiate with criminals," said
Patricia Gonzalez, whose term as attorney general ended Oct. 3. She was seated
at the desk where her brother was kidnapped. Two truckloads of heavily armed
federal police guarded the entrance outside.
</P>
<P>
With the country's legal system unable to expose the extent of corruption that
allows criminal networks here to flourish, many war-weary Mexicans appear
willing to consider the charges made in the videos as possibly true, at least in
part.
</P>
<P>
Chihuahua Gov. Cesar Duarte Jaquez announced that the state, working with the
federal attorney general, would investigate the charges and release the results
to the public.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez described how former Chihuahua Gov. Jose Reyes Baeza and Mexican Army
Gen. Felipe Espitia, the head of military's anti-narcotics operations here, met
with top leaders of the Juarez cartel at a ranch, and along with Patricia
Gonzalez ordered the assassinations of prominent journalists and community
leaders. The victims included the lead crime reporter at El Diario newspaper in
Ciudad Juarez, a popular local Mormon leader and a rural activist who spoke out
against the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
"I ask forgiveness from God and the people for having killed so many innocent
people. We were sick with power, me, my sister, the governor and all of the
people in the Juarez cartel," an ashen-faced Gonzalez said in a rote manner in a
video uploaded Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Patricia Gonzalez arrived in office promising to reform the state's judicial
system, reduce police abuses and bring justice to the families of hundreds of
women slain in Ciudad Juarez. But Chihuahua's climate of criminal impunity has
only worsened.
</P>
<P>
In Ciudad Juarez, police and prosecutors have identified suspects in only 3
percent of the more than 2,000 homicides committed here between January and
August this year, according to tallies by El Diario. "Our justice system has
collapsed," Gonzalez said, insisting the state needs to triple the number of
prosecutors and state police.
</P>
<P>
Patricia Gonzalez acknowledged that many might believe the worst about public
officials. "They believe there are close ties between drug trafficking and
government institutions," she said.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said her brother was kidnapped by a man who calls himself "El Puma
Original," leader of a death squad under the command of the Sinaloa cartel,
which is at war with the Juarez mafia for control of the state.
</P>
<P>
She suspects El Puma played the role of grand inquisitor in the videos. A
comment posted by an El Puma on a popular website boasted that the captors would
make Mario Gonzalez "sing."
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez assumes that El Puma is a former police officer. She said she made many
enemies during her six years as attorney general. "We fired 350 police and
prosecutors," Gonzalez said. "I think there are clear elements that indicate
that the state police are involved in my brother's kidnapping."
