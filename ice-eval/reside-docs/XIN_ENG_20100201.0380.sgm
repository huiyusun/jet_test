A former top judicial official in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality stood
trial Tuesday on charges of protecting mafia-style gangs and other crimes, the
latest court hearing in the city's sweeping crackdown on gang crimes.
</P>
<P>
Wen Qiang, 55, former director of the Chongqing Municipal Judicial Bureau, was
also accused of taking bribes, rape and owning huge amounts of money and assets
he could not justify, heard the Chongqing Municipal No. 5 Intermediate People's
Court.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Wen took bribes totaling more than 16 million yuan (2.4 million
U.S. dollars) personally or through his wife Zhou Xiaoya from 1996 to 2009 from
ring leaders, government officials, companies and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
To return favors to bribers, Wen, who had served as a senior police officer in
Chongqing for 16 years, gave protection to gangs, offered posts for officials,
and helped companies and businessmen obtain gains and evade police
investigations, prosecutors said.

<P>
Wen was also charged with raping a university student on several occasions in
2007 and 2008.

in his personal assets.

Other defendants also brought to the court together with Wen Tuesday included
his wife Zhou Xiaoya and three senior former Chongqing policemen, Huang
Daiqiang, Zhao Liming and Chen Tao.

Zhou was accused of seeking gains for others and illegally taking money of 8.16
million yuan from them by taking the advantage of being the spouse of government
official.
</P>
<P>
The three former police officers face a series of charges including bribery and
protecting gangs.
