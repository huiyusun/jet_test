BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua)

<P>
China's Chief Justice Wang Shengjun said Thursday that courts will take actions
on judicial corruption to prevent abuse of judicial power after a former vice
president of the supreme court was jailed for life two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court (SPC) will "strengthen capacity building and act as a
model for local courts," Wang, SPC president, told nearly 3,000 lawmakers at the
annual parliament session when delivering a work report.
</P>
<P>
The pledge came after Huang Songyou, former SPC vice president, was sentenced on
Jan. 19 to life imprisonment for taking bribes and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
Huang was convicted of taking more than 3.9 million yuan (about 574,000 U.S.
dollars) of bribes from 2005 to 2008.
</P>
<P>
Wang said nearly 800 court officials were punished for violating laws last year.
</P>
<P>
Courts at all levels should "learn a lesson from the case of Huang Songyou" to
find out rooted problems on the management of judges and supervision of power,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The SPC has appointed discipline supervisors in its 14 departments and more than
27,700 supervisors are watching over nearly 3,000 courts nationwide, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor-General Cao Jianming said in a separate report the same day that
prosecutors investigated more than 2,700 judiciary workers suspected of graft
and malpractice for personal gains last year.
</P>
<P>
Cao said the authority will "never relax its efforts" in crack down on judicial
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Judiciary staff will be punished if they are found "meddling and intervening
court cases, giving bribes to law enforcement personnel, beating or verbally
abusing petitioners and over- running timetables in enforcing court rulings,"
according to an SPC regulation earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Cao said in the report that efforts should be made to "resolutely punish corrupt
act in the judicial sector to purify the judicial team and safeguard integrity
and justice."
</P>
<P>
An extensive anti-gang crackdown in southwestern Chongqing municipality since
last year revealed a grave situation of judicial corruption. About 200 judicial
and public security officials in the city have been found to be implicated.
</P>
<P>
Wen Qiang, former deputy police chief and head of the justice bureau of
Chongqing, stood trial last month. He was accused of raping, taking more than 15
million yuan of bribes to protect criminal gangs, and possessing a huge amount
of unexplainable assets.
