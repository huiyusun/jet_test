"Mr. Alan Gross is in custody for violating Cuban laws and committing serious
crimes in our country by serving the subversive policy of the United States
against Cuba," said Bruno Rodriguez during a press conference in Havana.

Gross was arrested in Havana on December 5 last year for distributing laptops,
satellite phones and other technological equipment among groups opposing to
leader Raul Castro, the Cuban authorities said.

has received permanent consular assistance and had communications with his
family.

added that he was dedicated to connect Cuban citizens to Internet as an employee
of the Development Alternatives Inc.
