A plane has overshot the runway at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, the United
States on Friday, according to the NBC report.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the pilot of the corporate jet went "too long" on the landing
and the plane hit an "arrester bed," which crumbled under the weight of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear what caused the plane to go into the safety bed --
aerated cement blocks that are designed to fall apart under the weight of a
plane, stopping it from veering out of control at the end of runway.
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates
the airport, was quoted as saying that seven passengers and two pilots were
aboard the G-4 Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at about 1:45 p.m. local time Friday, she said.

<P>
Teterboro, near New York City, handles primarily smaller private and corporate
jets and is among the busiest in the country for that class of airport.
