<P>
Cuban authorities have continued to investigate U.S. contractor Alan Gross,
arrested a year ago on espionage charges, Attorney General Dario Delgado said
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Delgado chaired the 10th International Criminal Sciences Meeting 2010  at the
Havana Convention Palace until Thursday, attended by 300 specialists from over
20 nations from Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The investigation is still in the same situation. Our investigation has not
completed yet. We are still working and when we finish, we will give an official
answer," Delgado said.
</P>
<P>
Gross was arrested on Dec. 3, 2009 at the Havana Airport, and was accused of
providing internet satellite communication equipment to the anti-Castro groups
based on the island.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has called for his release on humanitarian grounds, saying that Gross
was only providing an internet connection to the Cuban Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
The detainee's wife, Judy Gross, wrote to Cuban leader Raul Castro in August to
express regret for her husband's work in Cuba. The Cuban authorities have
allowed Gross' wife to visit him at least once at a military hospital in Havana
where he was detained.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Gross has criticized the White House for not doing enough and described her
husband as "a victim caught in the crossfire between the two foes of the old
Cold War."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department recently dismissed an alleged plan to exchange Gross
for one of the five Cubans imprisoned since 1998 in the United States under
espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
The case has been handled by officials of both countries when they met in Havana
and Washington on migration and other bilateral issues.
