I grabbed this little review off of Dime and thought some people,
especially TB would be interested in this.

If this story is true, it is pretty damn sad.

Van Halen
Meadowlands Izod Center
East Rutherford, New Jersey
United States of America
November 3, 2007

Notes: I was going to call this one &quot;Meltdown at the Meadowlands,&quot; but
after I heard the sound quality, not to mention the fact that it is
incomplete, I decided to pass on the formalities such as titles,
artwork, etc. The show is in the category of forgettable (or
unforgettable..depends how you look at things). I guess the high point
of the evening's drama was Eddie Van Halen stomping around like a 3-
year old because his guitar cable kept getting tangled (as he yanked
on it violently)...no wait...it would have to be him
screaming..SCREAMING at the tech guys on the side of the stage for the
better part of the show...no...the part where he flipped the monitor
over, because it was either too loud, or he didn't like what was
coming out of it..no...maybe it was when he picked said monitor up and
threw it across the stage...NO..I got it..it was when he proceeded to
pick up the monitor and throw it OFF the stage. That was it.

I'm not making any of this up.

There were some other noteworthy occurrences..like during one of Ed's
fits, where he was switching guitars..&quot;and the Cradle Will Rock&quot;
starts..only problem is..Ed is not holding a guitar..but it starts
nonetheless, with the swoosing flanged guitar..that's he's not
playing..it's pre-recorded..so is the rhythm part..I'm pretty sure
it's a keyboard, but I never noticed it, because he was usually
playing. This show seemed to measure up to the KC show everyone was
talking about..except Dave was great. I gained a newfound respect for
him tonight, as he was the consumate professional as his bandmate
stomped, sneared and screamed through 90% of the show, during which he
paid little attention to his playing, stopping at times, screwing up
at others. After the monitor toss, he pretty much threw and swatted at
anything and everything in his path.

I feel bad for Wolfie too. I can tell this is all getting to him fast.
He looked like he wanted to be ANYWHERE else for pretty much the
entire show. At times I caught him staring at Ed with this &quot;what the
f*ck??&quot; look on his face. At one point, after one of his meltdowns, I
guess Ed realized that yeh..there are like 10,000 people watching
this, he tried to do his goofy dancing and jumping pikes, then he goes
over to Wolfie's side and picks up a straw cowboy hat, puts it on,
then tries to put it on Wolf, only Wolfs backs up, slaps the hat away,
then proceeds to kick it off the stage into the crowd.

This thing is unravelling..fast. After the monitor throwing incident,
Ed came back up and looked almost possessed. Very sad indeed. Sad for
everyone involved. Sad for the fans that shelled out $500 to be in the
VIP circle. Actually, it was sad for any fan who shelled out even $1
to see this charade tonight. Saddest of all for the multi-millionaire
guitarist whose band is making 1.5 million per show that he can't put
everything aside for 2 hours a day, play his music and act like a
swell guy.

In any event..here it is. The recording matches the performance. BTW -
I'm not on the whole VH-bashing bandwagon either. I'm just really
disgusted at the show Ed turned in last night. I considered not going
to MSG next week, but figured I might as well, and hopefully go out on
a high note.

Watching a couple of Tom Petty shows recently...yeah, he still has a power
cable plugged into his guitar.
That's one reason (of many) why he's still the epitome of rock and roll
coolness....

I see it more often at festivals when they're running bands (and their

Coincidentally, I happened to listen to &quot;And The Cradle Will Rock&quot; on
headphones one day last week while walking the dog, and I had the mini-
revelation that that cool rhythm part does indeed sound like a treated/
overdriven keyboard. Pretty neat production trick lo those many years
ago.

Van Halen Meltdown is totally the name of my new band.

Just for the record, that's an audio cable, not a power cable, and
many, many bands still plug in.  Wireless technology is far from
perfect.  There's a thousand things that can go wrong, mostly
interference.  You've all seen it...no matter how much redundancy they
have, wireless mics go dead all the time.  And, the governement's been
screwing with frequency allocations lately, and that further
complicates the matter.

&gt; everything aside for 2 hours a day, play his music and act like a
&gt; swell guy.
">

Unfortunately, this guy's account is pretty much on the money, if a little
over dramatized.  There's already a clip on YouTube of the band's
performance of &quot;Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love&quot; from near the end of the show and
Eddie's guitar is drastically out of tune from banging it around during his
preceding solo spot and he just can't compensate with his diminished playing
skills:

http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ld4n_1Wwl9c

Note that at the very last second of the clip at the end of the song, Eddie
throws his guitar at or to his tech.

I can't say the tour is &quot;unraveling,&quot; as there's really been only two bum
shows so far, this one and the KC show a couple weeks ago.  However, there
*are* nagging problems mostly to do with very iffy arena sound and monitor
and guitar tuning issues pretty much revolving around Eddie  Take that into
account with the fact Eddie fired his regular guitar tech (who went online
on a guitar gear message board and hinted Eddie was impossible to work for)
only a couple weeks before the tour started makes me wonder if the current
tech is simply unable to cope with Eddie's undoubtedly difficult primadonna
music and personal issues or worse (or perhaps better, heh) is fucking with
Eddie on purpose just because Ed's such a prick to work for these days.

It is rather funny that the supposed weak links of this lineup, being Roth
and Eddie's young son have more than surpassed any expectations while Eddie
just can't seem to consistently keep it together onstage.

I've seen hundreds of bands, many shows in every sort of venue possible and
it simply appears Eddie and by virtue the band is having an unprecedented
amount of sound issues from monitors, to earpiece volume to amps to his
guitar being constantly out of tune compared to anyone else I've ever seen
including Van Halen up through '98 and it actually appears to be getting
worse, not better on a show by show basis.  One band whom I've seen have a
lot of guitar issues live, U2, always has The Edge's guitar tech right there
with a new guitar if Edge breaks a string or has a instrument problem. It's
astounding Eddie Van Halen is going night after night with these sort of
problems through big chunks of the show.

Regarding the guitar cable issue many people wonder about, yeah, a lot of
musicians still use cables for a variety of reasons, one being wireless
technology is far from sonically perfect (although in a huge arena, no one
could probably notice the difference, especially concerning Eddie's tone
which is pretty harsh and ratty these days), plus the transmitter/receiver
can pick up interference or outside broadcasts (see the infamous scene in
&quot;Spinal Tap&quot;) especially outdoors.  The thing is, a guy like Eddie who moves
all over the stage and is constantly tripping over and fiddling with the
cable, he really should be wireless and in fact, always was up until 1998
and his tone never suffered live - in fact it sounds worse the past couple
tours than it ever has. Being chained to a cable, he doesn't go out on the
ramp at all and is pretty much limited to his 25 feet of space around his
rig.

I'm going to the first show at Staples Arena in LA on 11/20, and have a 5th
row seat right on Eddie's side like the unrepentant VH nerdliner I still am.
It's tough to say which I'm looking forward to more, this lineup playing the
songs from the first 6 albums or a true onstage meltdown of Chernobyl sized
proportions.  To be fair, when I saw the mediocre Sammy Hagar reunion in
'04, that tour was getting slammed because Eddie was absolutely wasted on
stage at most shows and they wound up turning in one of the most solid shows
of the tour at the Staples show I caught. Thus it's fair to assume they'll
bring their &quot;A&quot; game to LA for the hometown crowd which I expect will
welcome these guys like conquering heroes.

Here's a musical meltdown that occurred early in the tour during their
encore of &quot;Jump&quot;
from the Greensboro, NC show. Listen how out of tune Eddie's guitar
was with their
pre-recorded synth part.  I'm surprised he didn't throw something
then.

Dude, the premium seats inside the &quot;ring&quot; in front of the stage being sold
through ILove AllAccess.com which is part of Live Nation are going for
upwards of $1,500 a pop.
