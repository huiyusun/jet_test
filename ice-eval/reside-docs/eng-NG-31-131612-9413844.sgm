March 25, 1961 found Elvis at the Bloch Arena at Pearl Harbor. His performance and support raised money and awareness which enabled the USS Arizona Memorial to be completed the following year. This was Elvisâ€™ last live, non-movie performance until his 1968 television special.

Elvis never left the building like we thought, if you listen close you can still hear him singing.
