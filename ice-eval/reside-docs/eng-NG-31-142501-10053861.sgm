No, it ain't me. Sounds like it's you.

31 ¶ Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy [against] the [Holy] Ghost shall not be
forgiven unto men.

(New Testament | Matthew 12:31)

&quot;He that doth evil, let him do evil still: and he which is filthy, let him
be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be *MORE* righteous:
and he that is holy, let him be *MORE* holy.&quot;

~~Revelation 22:11 (1534 Tyndale translation)

&quot;He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him
be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and
he that is holy, let him be holy still.&quot;

~~Revelation 22:11 (1611 King James Version)

34 And wo be unto him that will not hearken unto the words of Jesus, and
also to them whom he hath chosen and sent among them; for whoso receiveth
not the words of Jesus and the words of those whom he hath sent receiveth
not him; and therefore he will not receive them at the last day;

35 And it would be better for them if they had not been born. For do ye
suppose that ye can get rid of the justice of an offended God, who hath been
trampled under feet of men, that thereby salvation might come?

(Book of Mormon | 3 Nephi 28:34 - 35)

5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the
heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the
water:

6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:

7 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in
store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of
ungodly men.

(New Testament | 2 Peter 3:5 - 7)

6 Yea, wo unto him that shall deny the revelations of the Lord, and that
shall say the Lord no longer worketh by revelation, or by prophecy, or by
gifts, or by tongues, or by healings, or by the power of the Holy Ghost!

7 Yea, and wo unto him that shall say at that day, to get gain, that there
can be no miracle wrought by Jesus Christ; for he that doeth this shall
become like unto the son of perdition, for whom there was no mercy,
according to the word of Christ!

8 Yea, and ye need not any longer hiss, nor spurn, nor make game of the
Jews, nor any of the remnant of the house of Israel; for behold, the Lord
remembereth his covenant unto them, and he will do unto them according to
that which he hath sworn.

(Book of Mormon | 3 Nephi 29:6 - 8)

29 For where is the disputer that there is a God in that day which shall
burn, even as an oven, saith the Lord?

30 Now of these things, ye must judge.

31 For it is that by what judgment, saith the Lord, that a man judgeth, that
he shall also be judged, and it shall be unto every man, even according to
his work.

Revelations of Jesus Christ 8:29-31

&quot;Judgment [of God is] according to opportunity for acquiring truth.&quot;

~~Art Bulla, Apostle of Jesus Christ

3 And it is that this death cometh upon all those who deny me and
*PERSIST* therein and who will not repent, neither can they, saith
the Lord God of Israel who it is that doth speak unto thee, O man,
whom I the Lord God have created in mine own image, even in the
image of mine Only Begotten Son have I created thee.

Revelations of Jesus Christ 43:3

30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance [belongeth] unto me, I will
recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.

31 [It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

(New Testament | Hebrews 10:30 - 31)

13 And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of the wicked, yea, who
are evil--for behold, they have no part nor portion of the Spirit of the
Lord; for behold, they chose evil works rather than good; therefore the
spirit of the devil did enter into them, and take possession of their
house--and these shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be
weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, and this because of their own
iniquity, being led captive by the will of the devil.

14 Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked, yea, in darkness,
and a state of awful, fearful looking for the fiery indignation of the
wrath of God upon them; thus they remain in this state, as well as
the righteous in paradise, until the time of their resurrection.

(Book of Mormon | Alma 40:13 - 14)

20 For it was that them before the flood obtained promise of deliverance
in the resurrection from hell, which shall not be given unto this
generation, saith the Lord, for thou hast also blasphemed against
the Holy Ghost, O liberal man and woman, which they did not do before
the flood.

Revelations of Jesus Christ 24:20

I didn't cast no spell on Norman Mailer either. Yea, thus saith the Lord of
hosts, Mailer did it to himself. (10:32 pm, Nov 13, 2007)

Norman Mailer Passes at 84

With great sorrow, the family of Norman Mailer announces his passing
on November 10, at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City. The cause was
acute renal failure. He was eighty four.

Mailer resided in Provincetown, Massachusetts, with his wife of 33 years,
Norris Church Mailer, and maintained an apartment in Brooklyn, New York.

He was the author of more than 30 books, the director of four films, and
a co-founder of the Village Voice. He ran for mayor of New York in the
1969 Democratic primary, and was a member of the American Institute of
Arts and Letters. He won many literary awards, including two Pulitzers and
the National Book Award.

His latest book, *On God: an Uncommon Conversation*, was
published on October 16th.

*On God: an Uncommon Conversation* (2007),
by Norman Mailer, with Michael Lennon:

Norman Mailer:
Oh, Christ, Mike, I don't think in these formulae. I want to get to
something more basic to my thought, which is that much of the world's
present-day cosmology is based on such works of revelation as the Old and
New Testament, or the Koran, yet for me Revelation is itself the question
mark. Revelation, after all, is not God's words but ours, words debated back
then, if you will, in committee and assembled by working theologians with
varying agendas. After all, why would God bother to speak in such a fashion?
There's no need. God could have imparted such thoughts directly to us.
Revelation has always struck me as a power trip for high priests who were
looking to create a product that would enable them to lead their flock more
securely, more emphatically. Their modern-day practitioners quote constantly
from Scripture on TV, use it as their guide rail, and run into intolerable
contradictions that are guaranteed to cripple their power to reason. I will
go so far as to say that to be a Fundamentalist is to exist as a human whose
reasoning powers have been degraded into inanition before any question for
which a Fundamentalist does not already have an answer.

I confess, then, that I feel no attachment whatsoever to organized religion.
I see God, rather, as a Creator, as the greatest artist. I see human beings
as His most developed artworks. I also see animals as His artworks. When I
think of evolution, what stands out most is the drama that went on in God as
an artist. Successes were also marred by failures. I think of all the errors
He made in evolution as well as of the successes. In marine life, for
example, some fish have hideous eyes -- they protrude from the head in tubes
many inches long. Think of all those animals of the past with their peculiar
ugliness, their misshapen bodies, worm life, frog life, vermin life, that
myriad of insects -- so many unsuccessful experiments. These were also modes

the Artist was trying -- this great artist, this divine artist -- to express
something incredible, and it was not, for certain, an easy process. Indeed,
it went on forever! I would guess that evolution was tampered with, if not
actually blindsided on occasion, by the Devil. I think there were false
trips that God engaged in because the Devil deluded Him -- or Her. Forgive
me if I keep speaking of God as &quot;Him,&quot; that's a habit that's come down to me
from Revelation. Obviously, to speak of God as &quot;Her&quot; is off-putting, but to
speak of &quot;Him/Her&quot; or &quot;It&quot; is worse.

In any event, it makes sense to me that this strife between God and the
Devil has been a factor in evolution. Whether God had a free hand or the
Devil was meddling in it from the commencement -- either way, some species
were badly conceived. Sometimes a young artist has to make large errors
before he or she can go farther.

14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou
[art] cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy
belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:

(Old Testament | Genesis 3:14)

Every man upon the earth, professing Christians or non-professing, must hear
it, and will know it sooner or later.  They came here, organized the raw
material, and arranged in their order the herbs of the field, the trees, the
apple, the peach, the plum, the pear, and every other fruit that is
desirable and good for man; the seed was brought from another sphere, and
planted in this earth.  The thistle, and thorn, the brier, and the obnoxious
weed did not appear until after the earth was cursed.  When Adam and Eve had
eaten of the forbidden fruit, their bodies became mortal from its effects,
and therefore their offspring were mortal.

~~Journal of Discourses, Vol.1, Pg.50, Brigham Young, April 9, 1852
