Gen-Aff recall grows faster than the others because it has a lot of shared arg1-arg2 pairs with Org-Aff and Part-Whole, therefore it is easier to get more recall.
On the other hand, precision is much lower compared to the other two for the same reason.	

low precision because once Per-gpe is introduced, it mis tags a lot of Org-aff and phys as gen-aff, causing the big drop in precision.
